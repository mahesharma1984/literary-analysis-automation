### DEVICE 1: First-Person Narration

#### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**First-Person Narration is:**

Story told from the perspective of a character using 'I'

**Example from model:** when I first knew it

---

#### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Your Turn:** Find an example of **First-Person Narration** in *To Kill a Mockingbird*.

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **TOPIC** - the device you will analyze.

**Teacher Checkpoint:** Did students complete matching BEFORE moving to multiple choice? ☐ Yes ☐ No  
*(If No, STOP. Process breakdown - return to matching.)*

**Your Answer:** ______

**TVODE Note:** This is your **OBJECT** - what the device does or shows in the text.

**Design Note:** Answers describe function/purpose (WHAT the device does), not effect (WHY). Two options should be "quite possible." All answers should be the same length, a single clause; don't use complex sentences for answers. Make sure you randomize multiple choice answers across questions for device 1, 2, 3, etc.

---
