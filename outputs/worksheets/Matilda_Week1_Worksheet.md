## PART A: THESIS ALIGNMENT

**Purpose:** Understand how this week's focus connects to the text's overall meaning

### The Text's Overall Thesis

Text Selection: *Matilda* (1988) by Roald Dahl represents a sophisticated children's novel that operates on multiple interpretive levels, making it an ideal candidate for comprehensive literary analysis.

**Key Elements:**

### This Week's Role in the Thesis

**Chapter Function:** Exposition

**Dramatic Purpose:** These opening chapters introduce the main characters, setting, and initial circumstances. This establishes the foundation for the central conflict and themes that will drive the entire narrative.

**Thematic Connection:**

- Devices in this section work together to establish the exposition function
- The exposition section connects to the text's central themes through device usage
- These devices build meaning that supports the overall narrative purpose

**What to Notice:**

1. Literary devices like Third-Person Omniscient, Hyperbole work together to establish characters, setting, and initial circumstances
2. Devices maintain narrative coherence while fulfilling the exposition function
3. Devices build meaning that connects to the text's overall exploration of its central themes

## SECTION 2: DEVICE ANALYSIS (Building TVODE Components)

**Note to Students:** The answers you create in this section will become parts of your analytical sentence in the TVODE worksheet.

---

### DEVICE 1: Third-Person Omniscient

#### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Third-Person Omniscient is:**

A narrative voice that knows the thoughts, feelings, and motivations of all characters and can comment on the story's events

**Example from model:** It's a funny thing about mothers and fathers. Even when their own child is the most disgusting little blister

---

#### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Your Turn:** Find an example of **Third-Person Omniscient** in *Matilda*.

**Where to look:**
Chapter 1, opening paragraphs describing It

**My Example:**

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **TOPIC** - the device you will analyze.

---

**Teacher Checkpoint:** Did students complete matching BEFORE moving to multiple choice? ☐ Yes ☐ No  
*(If No, STOP. Process breakdown - return to matching.)*

---

#### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**What does Third-Person Omniscient DO in this text? What is its purpose or function?**

**A)** Establishes symbolic meaning  
**B)** Shows literal description without literary technique  
**C)** Shows parental delusion and society's tolerance of it  
**D)** Creates vivid sensory imagery

**Your Answer:** ______

**TVODE Note:** This is your **OBJECT** - what the device does or shows in the text.

**Design Note:** Answers describe function/purpose (WHAT the device does), not effect (WHY). Two options should be "quite possible." All four options must be similar length (one clause each, roughly 10-15 words). Avoid making the correct answer noticeably longer or more specific than distractors. Randomize correct answer position across devices (don't always make B correct).

---

#### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Put these details in order to show HOW Third-Person Omniscient is used in the text.**

**A)** Third-Person Omniscient emphasizes parental delusion and society's tolerance of it in the description  
**B)** This establishes It through parental delusion and society's tolerance of it in Exposition  
**C)** Reader encounters "It's a funny thing about mothers and fathers. Even when thei..." in Chapter 1

**Your Answer:** 1-___ , 2-___ , 3-___



**Teacher Note:** When generating worksheets, RANDOMIZE the order of options A, B, C so the correct sequence is NOT 1-A, 2-B, 3-C. Example correct answers: "1-C, 2-A, 3-B" or "1-B, 2-C, 3-A"

---

#### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Now that you understand HOW the device works, write the specific detail from the text that best shows this.**

Use this format: "shown through [specific detail/example from text]"

Your Detail:

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **DETAIL** - the specific textual evidence that supports your analysis.

**Teacher Note:** Students should write a phrase/short sentence based on their sequencing understanding. This becomes the Detail component of TVODE.

---

#### Step 6 (STANDARD/HIGH TIER): EFFECTS AND INSIGHTS

**Part A: Sort the Effects**

Read these effects and sort them into the three categories below.

**Tip:** Look for signal words:
- **What I Felt** → feeling words (uneasy, curious, tense, surprised)
- **What I Understood** → "shows," "reveals," "we learn," "tells us"
- **Big Idea** → "theme," "message," "the author is saying"

**Effects to Sort:**
1. Creates reader alignment with narrator's critical perspective on deluded parents
2. Reveals the universal nature of parental self-deception through authoritative commentary
3. Effect 4 for Third-Person Omniscient
4. Establishes theme that adults systematically fail to see children clearly
5. Effect 6 for Third-Person Omniscient
6. Effect 5 for Third-Person Omniscient

| What I Felt | What I Understood | Big Idea Connection |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
