# TEACHER ANSWER KEY: NARRATIVE VOICE IN TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD
**Week 4 | Chapters 1-3**

## TEACHING NOTES

**Introducing Narrative Voice:**
- Begin by having students identify who is telling the story and from what perspective
- Emphasize the dual perspective: adult Scout reflecting on childhood memories
- Use the opening paragraph to demonstrate how Harper Lee establishes this complex narrative voice
- Connect to the macro concept by asking: "How does the way a story is told affect what we understand?"

**Facilitating Macro-Micro Connection:**
- Help students see that narrative devices aren't just techniques—they serve the larger purpose of how the story is told
- Use think-alouds to model how first-person narration creates intimacy and limitations
- Show how stream of consciousness reveals character psychology in real-time

## SECTION 1: COMPREHENSION CHECK

**Activity 1: Narrator Identification**
- **Expected Response:** Scout (Jean Louise Finch) is the narrator, telling the story as an adult looking back on her childhood. Students should note the retrospective quality and mature insights mixed with childlike observations.

**Activity 2: Perspective Effects**
- **Expected Response:** The first-person child's perspective creates innocence about adult complexities (like prejudice), makes readers discover truth alongside Scout, and limits our knowledge to what Scout observes and understands.

## SECTION 2: DEVICE ANALYSIS ANSWERS

### FIRST-PERSON NARRATION

**Step 2: Strong Example**
*"When I was almost six and Jem was nearly ten..."* (Chapter 1, opening)
- Clear use of "I" 
- Establishes personal, intimate tone
- Shows retrospective adult voice describing childhood

**Step 3: Multiple Choice Answer**
**C) Creates intimacy between reader and narrator**
- *Brief explanation:* First-person narration makes readers feel close to Scout's experiences and thoughts, as if she's personally telling us her story.

**Step 4: Sequence**
**1-C, 2-A, 3-B**
- Establishes narrator → Creates intimacy → Limits perspective

**Step 5: Textual Detail Example**
*"I never understood her preoccupation with heredity"* - Shows adult Scout's retrospective understanding while maintaining connection to childhood confusion.

**Step 6: Categorization**
**READER CONNECTION** - First-person narration primarily creates emotional intimacy and personal investment in Scout's journey.

### STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS

**Step 2: Strong Example**
*"I was not so sure, but Jem told me I was being a girl, that girls always imagined things, that's why other people hated them so, and if I started behaving like one I could just go off and find some to play with"* (Chapter 4)
- Shows Scout's thoughts flowing naturally
- Captures child's reasoning process
- No formal punctuation breaks in thought pattern

**Step 3: Multiple Choice Answer**
**A) Reveals the natural flow of a character's thoughts**
- *Brief explanation:* Stream of consciousness presents thoughts as they occur naturally, without formal organization or filtering.

**Step 4: Sequence**
**1-B, 2-C, 3-A**
- Shows thinking process → Reveals psychology → Creates realism

**Step 5: Textual Detail Example**
Any passage where Scout's thoughts jump between topics or show her processing multiple ideas simultaneously, particularly when she's trying to understand adult behavior.

**Step 6: Categorization**
**CHARACTER PSYCHOLOGY** - Stream of consciousness reveals how Scout's mind works and helps readers understand her internal experience.

## COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS

**Misconception 1:** "First-person just means using 'I'"
- **Address by:** Emphasizing the effects and purposes, not just the mechanical identification. Ask "So what? Why does this matter to the story?"

**Misconception 2:** "Stream of consciousness is just confusing writing"
- **Address by:** Modeling how to follow the logic of thought patterns. Show how it actually makes characters more realistic and relatable.

**Misconception 3:** "The narrator is just Harper Lee"
- **Address by:** Distinguishing between author and narrator. Scout is a fictional character, not Lee herself, even though Lee may draw from personal experience.

**Misconception 4:** "All the narrative voice does is tell the story"
- **Address by:** Connecting to macro focus - narrative voice shapes HOW we understand events, not just what events occur. The telling is as important as the tale.

**Teaching Tip:** If students struggle with stream of consciousness identification, have them read passages aloud and listen for the natural rhythm of thinking versus formal writing structure.
