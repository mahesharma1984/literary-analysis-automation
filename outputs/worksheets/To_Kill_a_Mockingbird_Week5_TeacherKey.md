# TEACHER ANSWER KEY: Rhetorical Voice Analysis
**Week 5 | To Kill a Mockingbird | Chapters 23-24**

## TEACHING NOTES

**Introducing Rhetorical Voice:**
- Begin by explaining that Scout as adult narrator has knowledge her younger self lacks
- Emphasize how Harper Lee uses this dual perspective to create tension and meaning
- Connect to previous weeks: voice shapes how all other devices function
- Use think-aloud modeling to show how adult Scout's voice creates dramatic irony

**Facilitating Macro-Micro Connection:**
- Help students see that rhetorical devices aren't just "techniques" but tools that build the narrator's credible, sympathetic voice
- Guide them to notice how Lee's choice of Scout as narrator makes social criticism more palatable
- Emphasize that the "innocent child's perspective" is actually carefully constructed by an adult author

*Expected Response:* Students should recognize moments where adult Scout's wisdom shows through, such as understanding about social class that young Scout couldn't grasp, or foreshadowing about Boo Radley that creates suspense.
