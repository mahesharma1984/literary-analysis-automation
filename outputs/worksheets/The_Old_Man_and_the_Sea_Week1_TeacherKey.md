# TEACHER ANSWER KEY - Week 1: Exposition in The Old Man and the Sea

## TEACHING NOTES

**Introducing Exposition**: Begin by explaining that exposition establishes the "who, what, where, when" of a story. In *The Old Man and the Sea*, Hemingway's exposition is subtle but crucial—it establishes Santiago's situation, his relationship with the boy, and the fishing community's view of him.

**Facilitating Macro-Micro Connection**: Help students see that literary devices aren't just techniques to identify—they're tools authors use to achieve larger purposes. Each device analysis should connect back to how it helps establish the story's foundation (exposition).

**Pacing Suggestion**: Spend 10-15 minutes on Section 1, 25-30 minutes on Section 2 (allowing discussion between devices), and 10 minutes modeling Section 3 together.

## COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS

### Misconception 1: "Exposition is just the first paragraph"
**Reality**: Exposition can be woven throughout early chapters. Help students see how Hemingway continues revealing background information about Santiago's fishing history, his relationship with DiMaggio, etc.

### Misconception 2: "Direct dialogue always advances plot"
**Correction**: In exposition, dialogue often serves to establish relationships, reveal character backgrounds, or provide context rather than move action forward.

### Misconception 3: "Scenes are just description"
**Clarification**: Scenes involve action unfolding in real-time with specific details, not static description. Help students distinguish between scenic narration and summary.

### Misconception 4: "All characterization in Hemingway is indirect"
**Correction**: While Hemingway is famous for "showing not telling," he does use direct characterization strategically. The "undefeated" eyes description is a clear example.

**Assessment Tip**: Watch for students who identify devices correctly but struggle to connect them to exposition's purpose. Regularly ask "How does this help establish the story's foundation?"
