## SECTION 2: DEVICE ANALYSIS (Building TVODE Components)

**Note to Students:** The answers you create in this section will become parts of your analytical sentence in the TVODE worksheet.

---

### DEVICE 1: Metaphor

#### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Metaphor is:**

Implicit comparison between unlike things without using 'like' or 'as'

**Example from model:** Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o'clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum

---

#### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Your Turn:** Find an example of **Metaphor** in *To Kill a Mockingbird*.

**Where to look:**
Chapter 1, opening paragraph

**My Example:**

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **TOPIC** - the device you will analyze.

---

**Teacher Checkpoint:** Did students complete matching BEFORE moving to multiple choice? ☐ Yes ☐ No  
*(If No, STOP. Process breakdown - return to matching.)*

---

#### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**What does Metaphor DO in this text? What is its purpose or function?**

**A)** The author uses simile to compare the town to something old and tired  
**B)** The author uses metaphor to characterize the town as weary and worn down  
**C)** The author uses personification to give the town human emotions  
**D)** The author uses alliteration with the repeated 't' sound for emphasis

**Your Answer:** ______

**TVODE Note:** This is your **OBJECT** - what the device does or shows in the text.

**Design Note:** Answers describe function/purpose (WHAT the device does), not effect (WHY). Two options should be "quite possible." All answers should be the same length, a single clause; don't use complex sentences for answers. Make sure you randomize multiple choice answers across questions for device 1, 2, 3, etc.

---

#### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Put these details in order to show HOW Metaphor is used in the text.**

**A)** Identify the two unlike things being compared without 'like' or 'as'  
**B)** Determine what qualities are being transferred from one thing to the other  
**C)** Analyze how this comparison establishes the story's setting and atmosphere

**Your Answer:** 1-___ , 2-___ , 3-___

**Teacher Note:** Answers should be RANDOMIZED (not 1-2-3 order). Correct answer format: "1-B, 2-A, 3-C"

---

#### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Now that you understand HOW the device works, write the specific detail from the text that best shows this.**

Use this format: "shown through [specific detail/example from text]"

Your Detail:

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **DETAIL** - the specific textual evidence that supports your analysis.

**Teacher Note:** Students should write a phrase/short sentence based on their sequencing understanding. This becomes the Detail component of TVODE.

#### Step 6 (STANDARD/HIGH TIER): CATEGORIZE THE EFFECT

**Part A: Sort ALL the effects into categories**

Read these possible effects and write EACH ONE in the correct category box below:

**Effects to Sort:**

3. The metaphor establishes themes of stagnation, tradition, and the weight of time that pervade the narrative
4. The metaphor reflects the narrator's observational perspective and sets expectations for the types of characters who might inhabit such a place
5. The metaphor establishes the sleepy, unchanging setting that will serve as the backdrop for the story's central conflicts
