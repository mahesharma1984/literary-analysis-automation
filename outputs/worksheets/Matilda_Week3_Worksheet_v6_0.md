**Thematic Connection:**

- Devices in this section work together to establish the structure/climax function
- The structure/climax section connects to the text's central themes through device usage
- These devices build meaning that supports the overall narrative purpose

**What to Notice:**

1. Literary devices like Symbolism, Foreshadowing work together to serve the narrative function
2. Devices maintain narrative coherence while fulfilling the structure/climax function
3. Devices build meaning that connects to the text's overall exploration of its central themes

## SECTION 2: DEVICE ANALYSIS (Building TVODE Components)

**Note to Students:** The answers you create in this section will become parts of your analytical sentence in the TVODE worksheet.

---

### DEVICE 1: Symbolism

#### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Symbolism is:**

Objects, actions, or concepts that represent deeper meanings beyond their literal significance

**Example from model:** I only have to take a moment to get my eyes strong

---

#### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Your Turn:** Find an example of **Symbolism** in *Matilda*.

**Where to look:**
Chapter 16, when Matilda prepares to use her powers against Miss Trunchbull in the classroom

**My Example:**

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **TOPIC** - the device you will analyze.

---

**Teacher Checkpoint:** Did students complete matching BEFORE moving to multiple choice? ☐ Yes ☐ No  
*(If No, STOP. Process breakdown - return to matching.)*

---

#### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**What does Symbolism DO in this text? What is its purpose or function?**

**A)** Shows how Matilda's anger toward Miss Trunchbull builds throughout the story  
**B)** Reveals that exceptional children can develop powers when pushed to their limits  
**C)** Represents inner strength emerging when intelligence meets focused determination and necessity  
**D)** Demonstrates how Matilda's reading habits have given her supernatural mental abilities

**Your Answer:** ______

**TVODE Note:** This is your **OBJECT** - what the device does or shows in the text.

**Design Note:** Answers describe function/purpose (WHAT the device does), not effect (WHY). Two options should be "quite possible." All four options must be similar length (one clause each, roughly 10-15 words). Avoid making the correct answer noticeably longer or more specific than distractors. Randomize correct answer position across devices (don't always make B correct).

---

#### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Put these details in order to show HOW Symbolism is used in the text.**

**A)** Reader encounters Matilda's quiet moment of preparation before confronting Miss Trunchbull in Chapter 16  
**B)** The phrase about strengthening her eyes transforms from literal action into symbolic representation of focusing inner power  
**C)** Reader understands that telekinesis symbolizes how determination and intelligence can overcome impossible adult tyranny

**Your Answer:** 1-___ , 2-___ , 3-___



**Teacher Note:** When generating worksheets, RANDOMIZE the order of options A, B, C so the correct sequence is NOT 1-A, 2-B, 3-C. Example correct answers: "1-C, 2-A, 3-B" or "1-B, 2-C, 3-A"

---

#### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Now that you understand HOW the device works, write the specific detail from the text that best shows this.**

Use this format: "shown through [specific detail/example from text]"

Your Detail:

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **DETAIL** - the specific textual evidence that supports your analysis.

**Teacher Note:** Students should write a phrase/short sentence based on their sequencing understanding. This becomes the Detail component of TVODE.

- **Big Idea** → "theme," "message," "the author is saying"

**Effects to Sort:**
1. Creates wonder and excitement about the possibilities of human potential
2. Shows how extraordinary abilities can emerge from extraordinary circumstances
3. Reinforces the theme that children possess hidden powers that adults underestimate
