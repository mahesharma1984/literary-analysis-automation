## SECTION 2: DEVICE ANALYSIS (Building TVODE Components)

**Note to Students:** The answers you create in this section will become parts of your analytical sentence in the TVODE worksheet.

---

### DEVICE 1: Third-Person Omniscient

#### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Third-Person Omniscient is:**

Narrator who knows everything about all characters and can access any character's thoughts

**Example from model:** It's a funny thing about mothers and fathers

---

#### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Your Turn:** Find an example of **Third-Person Omniscient** in *Matilda*.

**Where to look:**
Chapter 1, the opening paragraphs where the narrator introduces the Wormwood family

**My Example:**

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **TOPIC** - the device you will analyze.

---

**Teacher Checkpoint:** Did students complete matching BEFORE moving to multiple choice? ☐ Yes ☐ No  
*(If No, STOP. Process breakdown - return to matching.)*

---

#### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**What does Third-Person Omniscient DO in this text? What is its purpose or function?**

**A)** Shows Matilda's thoughts and feelings about her parents' cruel treatment  
**B)** Reveals universal truths about how parents and teachers often fail children  
**C)** Describes the Wormwood family's daily routines and television watching habits  
**D)** Explains why some children like Matilda develop extraordinary mental powers

**Your Answer:** ______

**TVODE Note:** This is your **OBJECT** - what the device does or shows in the text.

**Design Note:** Answers describe function/purpose (WHAT the device does), not effect (WHY). Two options should be "quite possible." All four options must be similar length (one clause each, roughly 10-15 words). Avoid making the correct answer noticeably longer or more specific than distractors. Randomize correct answer position across devices (don't always make B correct).

---

#### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Put these details in order to show HOW Third-Person Omniscient is used in the text.**

**A)** Reader encounters the narrator's direct commentary: 'It's a funny thing about mothers and fathers' in Chapter 1's opening  
**B)** The omniscient perspective transforms this into a universal observation about parental blindness to their children's worth  
**C)** Reader accepts the narrator as a wise guide who understands both child and adult perspectives throughout the story

**Your Answer:** 1-___ , 2-___ , 3-___



**Teacher Note:** When generating worksheets, RANDOMIZE the order of options A, B, C so the correct sequence is NOT 1-A, 2-B, 3-C. Example correct answers: "1-C, 2-A, 3-B" or "1-B, 2-C, 3-A"

---

#### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Now that you understand HOW the device works, write the specific detail from the text that best shows this.**

Use this format: "shown through [specific detail/example from text]"

Your Detail:

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **DETAIL** - the specific textual evidence that supports your analysis.

**Teacher Note:** Students should write a phrase/short sentence based on their sequencing understanding. This becomes the Detail component of TVODE.

#### Step 6 (STANDARD/HIGH TIER): EFFECTS AND INSIGHTS

**Part A: Sort the Effects**

Read these effects and sort them into the three categories below.

**Tip:** Look for signal words:
- **What I Felt** → feeling words (uneasy, curious, tense, surprised)
- **What I Understood** → "shows," "reveals," "we learn," "tells us"
- **Big Idea** → "theme," "message," "the author is saying"

**Effects to Sort:**
1. Creates trust in narrator as someone who understands the adult world from child's perspective
2. Reveals universal patterns in how adults treat children across different contexts
3. Establishes narrative authority to critique adult-child power dynamics throughout the story
