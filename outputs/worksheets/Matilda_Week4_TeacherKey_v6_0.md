## ANSWER KEY: LITERARY ANALYSIS WORKSHEET

### ENTRY ACTIVITY: COMPREHENSION CHECK

**Activity 1: Key Words**
Expected responses will vary but should include terms related to Voice/Falling Action.

**Activity 2: Narrative Summary**
Students should identify major events in chronological order. Check for basic comprehension before proceeding to device analysis.

**Teacher Checkpoint:** If >80% struggle, re-read extract aloud before proceeding to Section 2.

---

## DEVICE 1: Dramatic Irony

### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Definition:** When readers know information that characters in the story do not

**Model Example:** 'Let me make sure I've got them right,' she said

---

### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Correct Answer:** Dramatic Irony

**Text Locations:**
{{DEVICE_1_EXAMPLE_LOCATIONS_FULL}}

**Sample Student Response:**
{{DEVICE_1_SAMPLE_RESPONSE}}

**Teaching Note:** {{DEVICE_1_TEACHING_NOTE}}

---

### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**Correct Answer:** C

**Rationale:** {{DEVICE_1_OPTION_RATIONALE}}

**Common Student Errors:**
- Selecting Option {{DEVICE_1_DISTRACTOR_1}}: Students may confuse function with effect
- Selecting Option {{DEVICE_1_DISTRACTOR_2}}: Students may focus on literal content rather than device purpose

---

### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Correct Answer:** 1-A, 2-B, 3-C

(e.g., "1-C, 2-A, 3-B" — varies per generated worksheet)

**Explanation:** {{DEVICE_1_SEQUENCE_EXPLANATION}}

**Teaching Note:** If students struggle, guide them to look at the chronology of how the device unfolds in the text.

---

### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Sample Student Response:**
"shown through Matilda's careful request: 'Let me make sure I've got them right,' she said"

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ✓ Specific reference to text (not vague)
- ✓ Directly supports the device usage
- ✓ Uses format: "shown through [specific detail]"

**Common Student Errors:**
- Writing a full quote instead of a paraphrased detail
- Being too vague (e.g., "shown through the writing")
- Describing effect instead of detail

---

### Step 6: EFFECTS AND INSIGHTS (STANDARD/HIGH TIER)

**Part A: Sorting Effects**

| What I Felt | What I Understood | Big Idea Connection |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| {{DEVICE_1_FELT_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_1_UNDERSTOOD_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_1_BIGIDEA_EFFECT_1}} |
| {{DEVICE_1_FELT_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_1_UNDERSTOOD_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_1_BIGIDEA_EFFECT_2}} |

**Signal Words to Highlight:**
- "What I Felt" effects contain: [list feeling words present]
- "What I Understood" effects contain: [list reveal/show words]
- "Big Idea" effects contain: [list theme words]

**Part B: Combination Examples**

| Combination | Sample Student Response |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Feeling → Understanding | "The unease I felt helped me realize that Jonas's society controls everything, even language." |
| Understanding → Big Idea | "This shows that words have power, which connects to the theme of control through language." |
| Big Idea → Feeling | "The theme of lost freedom is why readers feel uncomfortable about the 'precision of language' rule." |

**Part C: What Different Combinations Yield**

| Direction | Type of Insight | Student Learns... |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Feeling → Understanding | Personal discovery | How emotions unlock meaning |
| Understanding → Feeling | Craft appreciation | How authors manipulate readers |
| Understanding → Big Idea | Traditional analysis | Standard literary argument |
| Big Idea → Understanding | Thematic lens | Reading through theme |
| Feeling → Big Idea | Affective criticism | Emotion as evidence |
| Big Idea → Feeling | Author's purpose | Intentional emotional design |

**Teaching Note:** Accept any valid combination. The goal is showing students that effect analysis isn't one "right answer" but multiple valid angles. Swapping order changes the TYPE of insight, not its correctness.

---

## ASSESSMENT RUBRIC

### TVODE Sentence Construction (Per Device)

| Criterion | Emerging (1-2) | Developing (3-4) | Proficient (5-6) | Advanced (7-8) |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Topic** | Device not identified or incorrect | Device identified but unclear | Device clearly identified | Device clearly identified with sophisticated framing |
| **Verb** | Missing or inappropriate | Generic verb (uses) | Appropriate action verb | Precise, varied verb choices |
| **Object** | Unclear or missing | Function stated but incomplete | Function clearly stated | Function clearly stated with nuance |
| **Detail** | Missing or vague | Present but generic | Specific textual reference | Specific, integrated textual evidence |
| **Effect** | Missing | Stated but unclear | Clear impact on meaning | Sophisticated analysis of impact |

**Target Scores:**
- **EAL Tier:** 15-20 points (Developing-Proficient)
- **Standard Tier:** 20-30 points (Proficient)
- **High Tier:** 30-40 points (Proficient-Advanced)

---

## COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS TO ADDRESS

### Literary Analysis Phase

**Misconception 1:** "The device IS the theme"
- **Correction:** Devices are tools the author uses; they're not the same as themes. The device helps reveal or develop the theme.

**Misconception 2:** "Any example from the text counts"
- **Correction:** The example must specifically show the device in action, not just mention related content.

**Misconception 3:** "Effect and Object are the same thing"
- **Correction:** Object = what the device does. Effect = the impact on meaning/reader.

### TVODE Construction Phase

**Misconception 1:** "TVODE should be 5 separate sentences"
- **Correction:** TVODE is ONE integrated sentence with all components connected.

**Misconception 2:** "Detail means any quote from the text"
- **Correction:** Detail should be specific evidence showing HOW the device works.

**Misconception 3:** "I can write TVODE in any order"
- **Correction:** The order matters: T→V→O→D→E creates logical flow.

## DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGIES

### For Struggling Students (EAL)
- Pre-teach device definitions before worksheet
- Provide sentence frames for all activities
- Allow pair work for Step 6 Part B (combination building)
- Focus on 1 device only, master it completely

### For Advanced Students (High Tier)
- Add 3rd device for additional challenge
- Require integration of multiple text examples
- Ask for comparison of device usage across different sections
- Challenge them to identify additional devices not on worksheet

### For Students with Identified Needs
- Provide pre-filled model examples
- Allow oral responses recorded by teacher/aide
- Simplify Step 6 to Part A only (sorting), skip combination building
- Use highlighted text with devices pre-identified

## REFLECTION QUESTIONS FOR TEACHERS

After teaching this unit:
1. Did students successfully locate devices using the provided chapter/page references?
2. Which steps required the most re-teaching?
3. Were the example locations helpful for student preparation?
4. What percentage of students achieved proficiency on TVODE construction?
5. What adjustments would improve future delivery?
