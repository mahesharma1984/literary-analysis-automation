## SECTION 2: DEVICE ANALYSIS (Building TVODE Components)

**Note to Students:** The answers you create in this section will become parts of your analytical sentence in the TVODE worksheet.

---

### DEVICE 1: Dramatic Irony

#### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Dramatic Irony is:**

When readers know information that characters in the story do not

**Example from model:** 'Let me make sure I've got them right,' she said

---

#### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Your Turn:** Find an example of **Dramatic Irony** in *Matilda*.

**Where to look:**
Chapter 18, when Matilda visits Miss Honey's cottage and asks her to repeat Miss Trunchbull's personal information

**My Example:**

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **TOPIC** - the device you will analyze.

---

**Teacher Checkpoint:** Did students complete matching BEFORE moving to multiple choice? ☐ Yes ☐ No  
*(If No, STOP. Process breakdown - return to matching.)*

---

#### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**What does Dramatic Irony DO in this text? What is its purpose or function?**

**A)** Shows Miss Honey's confusion about Matilda's unusual interest in personal details  
**B)** Creates tension as readers know Matilda plans to confront Miss Trunchbull soon  
**C)** Builds suspense as readers understand Matilda's secret plan while Miss Honey doesn't  
**D)** Reveals Matilda's growing friendship with Miss Honey through their private conversation

**Your Answer:** ______

**TVODE Note:** This is your **OBJECT** - what the device does or shows in the text.

**Design Note:** Answers describe function/purpose (WHAT the device does), not effect (WHY). Two options should be "quite possible." All four options must be similar length (one clause each, roughly 10-15 words). Avoid making the correct answer noticeably longer or more specific than distractors. Randomize correct answer position across devices (don't always make B correct).

---

#### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Put these details in order to show HOW Dramatic Irony is used in the text.**

**A)** Readers encounter Matilda asking Miss Honey to repeat personal details about Miss Trunchbull in Chapter 18  
**B)** Readers recognize Matilda is memorizing information for her secret plan while Miss Honey thinks it's casual conversation  
**C)** Suspense builds as readers anticipate how Matilda will use this ammunition against Miss Trunchbull

**Your Answer:** 1-___ , 2-___ , 3-___



**Teacher Note:** When generating worksheets, RANDOMIZE the order of options A, B, C so the correct sequence is NOT 1-A, 2-B, 3-C. Example correct answers: "1-C, 2-A, 3-B" or "1-B, 2-C, 3-A"

---

#### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Now that you understand HOW the device works, write the specific detail from the text that best shows this.**

Use this format: "shown through [specific detail/example from text]"

Your Detail:

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **DETAIL** - the specific textual evidence that supports your analysis.

**Teacher Note:** Students should write a phrase/short sentence based on their sequencing understanding. This becomes the Detail component of TVODE.

#### Step 6 (STANDARD/HIGH TIER): EFFECTS AND INSIGHTS

**Part A: Sort the Effects**

Read these effects and sort them into the three categories below.

**Tip:** Look for signal words:
- **What I Felt** → feeling words (uneasy, curious, tense, surprised)
- **What I Understood** → "shows," "reveals," "we learn," "tells us"
- **Big Idea** → "theme," "message," "the author is saying"

**Effects to Sort:**
1. Builds anticipation and excitement about how Matilda will use this information
2. Shows Matilda's strategic thinking and careful preparation for confronting Miss Trunchbull
3. Reinforces the theme of children being more capable and calculating than adults realize
