# TEACHER ANSWER KEY: Literary Devices in To Kill a Mockingbird

## TEACHING NOTES

**Introducing Literary Devices:**
- Begin by emphasizing that literary devices are tools authors use intentionally to create specific effects
- Use familiar examples before diving into Harper Lee's text
- Stress that identifying devices is only the first step—analyzing their purpose and effect is crucial
- Encourage students to consider how devices work together to support larger themes

**Facilitating Macro-Micro Connection:**
- Help students see that literary devices serve Harper Lee's broader purposes (revealing character, building atmosphere, conveying themes about prejudice, loss of innocence, moral courage)
- Guide students to move beyond "Lee uses metaphor" to "Lee uses metaphor to reveal Scout's growing understanding of adult complexity"

## SECTION 1: COMPREHENSION CHECK

**Activity 1: Device Matching**
- Metaphor → "Mrs. Dubose was a dragon" (implicit comparison)
- Simile → "He was as good as his worst performance" (explicit comparison with "as")
- Personification → "The courthouse sagged" (building given human characteristic)
- Imagery → "Humid shadows of July" (appeals to touch and sight)
- Symbolism → The mockingbird (represents innocence)

**Activity 2: Quick Identification**
Students should identify 3-4 devices from a provided passage, focusing on the most obvious examples rather than forcing obscure connections.

## SECTION 3: SAMPLE TVODE SENTENCES

**Strong Examples:**
1. "Through her use of dialect variation between characters, Harper Lee reveals the rigid social hierarchies that divide Maycomb County, demonstrating how language itself becomes a tool of both oppression and resistance."

2. "Lee's symbolic use of the mockingbird throughout the novel reinforces her central theme that destroying innocence is a sin, connecting Tom Robinson's fate to the larger moral framework Scout must learn to navigate."

3. "By employing Scout's hyperbolic descriptions of childhood fears and adult behaviors, Lee captures the authentic voice of a child narrator while simultaneously highlighting the genuine dangers lurking beneath Maycomb's surface civility."

## COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS

**What Students Often Get Wrong:**

1. **Device hunting without purpose** - Students find devices but can't explain their effect
   - *Address by:* Always ask "So what?" after identification

2. **Confusing metaphor and simile** - Focus too much on like/as presence
   - *Address by:* Emphasize that both create comparisons; the key is analyzing the comparison's purpose

3. **Oversimplifying symbolism** - "The mockingbird means innocence" without exploration
   - *Address by:* Push for multiple symbolic meanings and trace development through text

4. **Ignoring narrator's age** - Missing that Scout's devices reflect child's perspective
   - *Address by:* Consistently return to Scout as 8-year-old narrator with adult reflection

5. **Separating devices from theme** - Analyzing in isolation rather than connecting to novel's larger purposes
   - *Address by:* Require thematic connection in every device analysis

6. **Forcing device identification** - Finding devices that aren't meaningfully there
   - *Address by:* Emphasize quality over quantity; not every sentence contains a significant device
