## SECTION 2: DEVICE ANALYSIS (Building TVODE Components)

**Note to Students:** The answers you create in this section will become parts of your analytical sentence in the TVODE worksheet.

---

### DEVICE 1: Direct Characterization

#### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Direct Characterization is:**

Explicit description of character traits by narrator or other characters

**Example from model:** She was all angles and bones; she was nearsighted; she squinted

---

#### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Your Turn:** Find an example of **Direct Characterization** in *To Kill a Mockingbird*.

**Where to look:**
- exposition: Direct physical description of Calpurnia establishes her stern appearance
- resolution: Mr. Raymond directly states his opinion of Atticus's character

**My Example:**

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **TOPIC** - the device you will analyze.

---

**Teacher Checkpoint:** Did students complete matching BEFORE moving to multiple choice? ☐ Yes ☐ No  
*(If No, STOP. Process breakdown - return to matching.)*

---

#### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**What does Direct Characterization DO in this text? What is its purpose or function?**

**A)** Establishes Calpurnia's physical appearance and Mr. Raymond's view of Atticus's character  
**B)** Creates vivid imagery of the small-town Southern setting  
**C)** Reveals the underlying social tensions between different community groups  
**D)** Shows how characters form their judgments about others in the community

**Your Answer:** ______

**TVODE Note:** This is your **OBJECT** - what the device does or shows in the text.

**Design Note:** Answers describe function/purpose (WHAT the device does), not effect (WHY). Two options should be "quite possible." All answers should be the same length, a single clause; don't use complex sentences for answers. Make sure you randomize multiple choice answers across questions for device 1, 2, 3, etc.

---

#### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Put these details in order to show HOW Direct Characterization is used in the text.**

**A)** Reader receives clear, unambiguous information about character traits without interpretation needed  
**B)** Other characters make direct statements about each other's moral qualities and nature  
**C)** Author provides explicit physical and personality details about characters through narrator's voice

**Your Answer:** 1-___ , 2-___ , 3-___

**Teacher Note:** Answers should be RANDOMIZED (not 1-2-3 order). Correct answer format: "1-B, 2-A, 3-C"

---

#### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Now that you understand HOW the device works, write the specific detail from the text that best shows this.**

Use this format: "shown through [specific detail/example from text]"

Your Detail:

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **DETAIL** - the specific textual evidence that supports your analysis.

**Teacher Note:** Students should write a phrase/short sentence based on their sequencing understanding. This becomes the Detail component of TVODE.

6. Eliminates reader ambiguity about character interpretation during crucial plot moments

**Category Definitions:**
- **Reader Response:** How the device affects what readers feel or experience
- **Meaning Creation:** How the device builds understanding or reveals ideas
- **Thematic Impact:** How the device connects to the text's bigger message or theme
