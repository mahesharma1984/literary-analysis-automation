## ANSWER KEY: LITERARY ANALYSIS WORKSHEET

### ENTRY ACTIVITY: COMPREHENSION CHECK

**Activity 1: Key Words**
Expected responses will vary but should include terms related to Exposition.

**Activity 2: Narrative Summary**
Students should identify major events in chronological order. Check for basic comprehension before proceeding to device analysis.

**Teacher Checkpoint:** If >80% struggle, re-read extract aloud before proceeding to Section 2.

---

## DEVICE 1: Metaphor

### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Definition:** Implicit comparison between unlike things without using 'like' or 'as'

**Model Example:** Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o'clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum

---

### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Correct Answer:** Metaphor

**Text Locations:**
{{DEVICE_1_EXAMPLE_LOCATIONS_FULL}}

**Sample Student Response:**
The phrase 'tired old town' is a metaphor that compares the town to something exhausted and aged

**Teaching Note:** Emphasize that metaphors in exposition serve dual purposes: creating vivid imagery and efficiently establishing mood and setting

---

### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**Correct Answer:** B

**Rationale:** {{DEVICE_1_OPTION_RATIONALE}}

**Common Student Errors:**
- Selecting Option Option A is incorrect because there is no use of 'like' or 'as' to create a simile; this is an implicit comparison characteristic of metaphor: Students may confuse function with effect
- Selecting Option Option C is incorrect because while 'tired' could suggest human qualities, the primary function here is metaphorical comparison rather than giving the town human actions or emotions: Students may focus on literal content rather than device purpose

---

### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Correct Answer:** A, B, C

**Explanation:** This order moves from basic identification of the metaphor's components, to understanding the comparison being made, to analyzing its function in exposition

**Teaching Note:** If students struggle, guide them to look at the chronology of how the device unfolds in the text.

---

### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Sample Student Response:**
"{{DEVICE_1_DETAIL_SAMPLE}}"

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ✓ Specific reference to text (not vague)
- ✓ Directly supports the device usage
- ✓ Uses format: "shown through [specific detail]"

**Common Student Errors:**
- Writing a full quote instead of a paraphrased detail
- Being too vague (e.g., "shown through the writing")
- Describing effect instead of detail

---

### Step 6: CATEGORIZE THE EFFECT (STANDARD/HIGH TIER)

**Part A: Sorting Effects**

| Reader Response | Meaning Creation | Thematic Impact |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| {{DEVICE_1_READER_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_1_MEANING_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_1_THEMATIC_EFFECT_1}} |
| {{DEVICE_1_READER_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_1_MEANING_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_1_THEMATIC_EFFECT_2}} |

**Part B: Correct Category for This Device:** {{DEVICE_1_EFFECT_CATEGORY}}

**Correct Effect:** {{DEVICE_1_EFFECT_CORRECT}}

**Teaching Note:** Help students distinguish between how they feel (Reader Response), what they understand (Meaning Creation), and what themes emerge (Thematic Impact).

---

## DEVICE 2: Simile

### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Definition:** Explicit comparison between unlike things using 'like' or 'as'

**Model Example:** her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard

---

### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Correct Answer:** Simile

**Text Locations:**
{{DEVICE_2_EXAMPLE_LOCATIONS_FULL}}

**Sample Student Response:**
This is a simile because it compares the woman's hand to a bed slat using 'as' to show how wide and hard her hand is

**Teaching Note:** Have students visualize the comparisons by drawing or acting them out to make the imagery more concrete and memorable

---

### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**Correct Answer:** B

**Rationale:** {{DEVICE_2_OPTION_RATIONALE}}

**Common Student Errors:**
- Selecting Option Option A is incorrect because metaphor makes direct comparisons without using 'like' or 'as': {{DEVICE_2_ERROR_1}}
- Selecting Option Option C is incorrect because personification involves giving human characteristics to non-human things, not making comparisons: {{DEVICE_2_ERROR_2}}

---

### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Correct Answer:** A, B, C

**Explanation:** This order is correct because students must first recognize what is being compared, then identify the connecting word that signals the simile, and finally interpret the deeper meaning of the comparison

---

### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Sample Student Response:**
"{{DEVICE_2_DETAIL_SAMPLE}}"

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ✓ Specific reference to text
- ✓ Supports the device usage
- ✓ Uses correct format

---

### Step 6: CATEGORIZE THE EFFECT (STANDARD/HIGH TIER)

**Part A: Sorting Effects**

| Reader Response | Meaning Creation | Thematic Impact |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| {{DEVICE_2_READER_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_2_MEANING_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_2_THEMATIC_EFFECT_1}} |
| {{DEVICE_2_READER_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_2_MEANING_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_2_THEMATIC_EFFECT_2}} |

**Part B: Correct Category:** {{DEVICE_2_EFFECT_CATEGORY}}

**Correct Effect:** {{DEVICE_2_EFFECT_CORRECT}}

---

## DEVICE 3 (HIGH TIER ONLY): Personification

### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Definition:** Attribution of human characteristics to non-human entities

**Model Example:** the courthouse sagged in the square

---

### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Correct Answer:** Personification

**Text Locations:**
{{DEVICE_3_EXAMPLE_LOCATIONS_FULL}}

**Sample Student Response:**
The courthouse is given the human action of sagging, as if it's tired or weighed down

**Teaching Note:** Emphasize that personification involves giving human traits to non-human things, not just describing things that look human-like

---

### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**Correct Answer:** B

**Rationale:** {{DEVICE_3_OPTION_RATIONALE}}

---

### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Correct Answer:** A, B, C

**Explanation:** This order moves from basic identification to deeper analysis, first recognizing what is being personified, then how it's being personified, and finally understanding the author's purpose

---

### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Sample Student Response:**
"{{DEVICE_3_DETAIL_SAMPLE}}"

---

### Step 6: CATEGORIZE THE EFFECT

**Part A: Sorting Effects**

| Reader Response | Meaning Creation | Thematic Impact |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| {{DEVICE_3_READER_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_3_MEANING_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_3_THEMATIC_EFFECT_1}} |
| {{DEVICE_3_READER_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_3_MEANING_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_3_THEMATIC_EFFECT_2}} |

**Part B: Correct Category:** {{DEVICE_3_EFFECT_CATEGORY}}

**Correct Effect:** {{DEVICE_3_EFFECT_CORRECT}}

---

### ACTIVITY 5: DEVICE SUMMARY PARAGRAPH

**Device 1 Model Response:**

The author uses the metaphor 'tired old town' to immediately establish the setting's weary, stagnant atmosphere, comparing the town to something worn down by age and fatigue, which creates a vivid impression of a place where little changes and life moves slowly, effectively setting up the story's exploration of tradition and resistance to change in a small Southern community.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ✓ Begins with T+V+O sentence
- ✓ Integrates Detail using appropriate connector
- ✓ Integrates Effect using appropriate connector
- ✓ Includes 1-2 additional explanatory sentences
- ✓ Maintains focus on device function

**Common Student Errors:**
- Writing summary of plot instead of device analysis
- Missing TVODE components
- Too much description, not enough analysis

---

**Device 2 Model Response:**

The author uses simile when describing "her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard" to compare the woman's hand to wooden bed slats, emphasizing both the impressive size and the callused, tough nature of hands shaped by years of physical labor, which establishes her as a strong, hardworking character in the exposition.

**Evaluation Criteria:** Same as Device 1

---

**Device 3 Model Response (High Tier):**

The personification in 'the courthouse sagged in the square' gives the building human characteristics of weariness and exhaustion, creating a vivid image of institutional decline that establishes the town's atmosphere of neglect and sets the stage for the story's exploration of social decay.

**Evaluation Criteria:** Same as Device 1

| **Object** | Unclear or missing | Function stated but incomplete | Function clearly stated | Function clearly stated with nuance |
| **Detail** | Missing or vague | Present but generic | Specific textual reference | Specific, integrated textual evidence |
| **Effect** | Missing | Stated but unclear | Clear impact on meaning | Sophisticated analysis of impact |

**Target Scores:**
- **EAL Tier:** 15-20 points (Developing-Proficient)
- **Standard Tier:** 20-30 points (Proficient)
- **High Tier:** 30-40 points (Proficient-Advanced)

---

## COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS TO ADDRESS

### Literary Analysis Phase

**Misconception 1:** "The device IS the theme"
- **Correction:** Devices are tools the author uses; they're not the same as themes. The device helps reveal or develop the theme.

**Misconception 2:** "Any example from the text counts"
- **Correction:** The example must specifically show the device in action, not just mention related content.

**Misconception 3:** "Effect and Object are the same thing"
- **Correction:** Object = what the device does. Effect = the impact on meaning/reader.

### TVODE Construction Phase

**Misconception 1:** "TVODE should be 5 separate sentences"
- **Correction:** TVODE is ONE integrated sentence with all components connected.

**Misconception 2:** "Detail means any quote from the text"
- **Correction:** Detail should be specific evidence showing HOW the device works.

**Misconception 3:** "I can write TVODE in any order"
- **Correction:** The order matters: T→V→O→D→E creates logical flow.

## DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGIES

### For Struggling Students (EAL)
- Pre-teach device definitions before worksheet
- Provide sentence frames for all activities
- Allow pair work for Step 6 (Effect categorization)
- Focus on 1 device only, master it completely

### For Advanced Students (High Tier)
- Add 3rd device for additional challenge
- Require integration of multiple text examples
- Ask for comparison of device usage across different sections
- Challenge them to identify additional devices not on worksheet

### For Students with Identified Needs
- Provide pre-filled model examples
- Allow oral responses recorded by teacher/aide
- Simplify Step 6 to 2 categories instead of 3
- Use highlighted text with devices pre-identified
