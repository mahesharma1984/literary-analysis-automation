# TEACHER ANSWER KEY: Week 1 - Exposition in *The Giver*

## TEACHING NOTES

**Introducing Exposition**: Begin by explaining that exposition is the foundation of any story—it's how authors introduce readers to the story world, characters, and situation. In *The Giver*, Lowry must carefully reveal information about Jonas's dystopian community without overwhelming readers or making the exposition feel forced.

**Macro-Micro Connection**: Help students see that the three devices (direct characterization, direct dialogue, scene) are Lowry's *tools* for delivering exposition. Each serves a specific purpose:
- **Direct characterization** efficiently establishes who characters are
- **Direct dialogue** reveals information naturally through conversation
- **Scene** shows the world in action, making abstract concepts concrete

**Facilitation Tip**: Use think-alouds to model how you identify exposition within each device. Ask: "What new information about this world/character am I learning here?"

- Introduction to Jonas's apprehension about the Ceremony of Twelve
- Details about daily rituals (dream-telling, feelings sharing)

**Activity 2 - Information Categories**
- **Setting/World**: Community rules, family structure, ceremonies, climate control
- **Characters**: Jonas's personality, family members' jobs and traits, Asher's characteristics

## SECTION 2: DEVICE ANALYSIS ANSWERS

### DIRECT CHARACTERIZATION

**Step 2: Strong Example**
*"Jonas's father was a gentle man who worked as a Nurturer of newchildren"* or *"Lily, barely seven, was very talkative"*

**Step 3: Multiple Choice Answer**
**B** - *Creates efficient character establishment*
*Explanation: Direct characterization allows Lowry to quickly establish key traits without lengthy descriptions, essential for smooth exposition.*

**Step 4: Sequence**
**1-C, 2-A, 3-B**
(C: Author states trait → A: Reader learns about character → B: Character's role in story becomes clear)

**Step 5: Textual Detail**
Look for students citing specific adjectives or descriptive phrases Lowry uses, such as "cheerful," "responsible," or "anxious."

**Step 6: Categorization**
**EXPOSITION** - *The primary function is introducing character information essential to understanding the story world and relationships.*

### DIRECT DIALOGUE

**Step 2: Strong Example**
*"I felt angry at the little ones... They don't deserve anything I feel!"* (Jonas about his frustration) or family dinner conversations about their days.

**Step 3: Multiple Choice Answer**
**A** - *Reveals information naturally through conversation*
*Explanation: Characters discussing their daily experiences allows Lowry to explain community rules and structure through realistic dialogue.*

**Step 4: Sequence**
**1-B, 2-C, 3-A**
(B: Characters speak → C: Information is revealed through their words → A: Reader learns about the world)

**Step 5: Textual Detail**
Students should note how characters discuss community concepts (Stirrings, Assignments, rules) as if they're normal, which helps readers understand this world's "normal."

**Step 6: Categorization**
**EXPOSITION** - *The dialogue primarily serves to introduce readers to community customs and character relationships rather than advance plot.*

### SCENE

**Step 2: Strong Example**
The family's evening ritual of sharing feelings, or Jonas's experience at the Ceremony (if covering Chapter 2), or morning routine descriptions.

**Step 3: Multiple Choice Answer**
**C** - *Shows the story world in action*
*Explanation: By presenting detailed scenes of daily life, Lowry demonstrates how this society functions rather than just telling readers about it.*

**Step 4: Sequence**
**1-A, 2-C, 3-B**
(A: Author presents action in detail → C: Reader experiences the world → B: Abstract concepts become concrete)

**Step 5: Textual Detail**
Look for students identifying sensory details, specific actions, or step-by-step descriptions of community rituals.

**Step 6: Categorization**
**EXPOSITION** - *These scenes primarily establish the story world and social structure rather than developing conflict or character growth.*

## SECTION 3: SAMPLE TVODE SENTENCES

1. *Lowry uses direct characterization to efficiently establish exposition by immediately identifying Jonas as "apprehensive" about the upcoming ceremony, which introduces both his personality and the story's central situation.*

2. *Through direct dialogue during family sharing time, Lowry delivers exposition about community rules and values, as characters naturally discuss concepts like "precision of language" and appropriate behavior.*

3. *Detailed scenes of morning and evening family rituals serve as exposition by showing readers exactly how this controlled society functions in daily life, making abstract concepts of "Sameness" concrete and observable.*

## COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS

**Misconception #1**: "Any dialogue/characterization/scene is exposition"
**Correction**: Emphasize that exposition specifically *introduces* new information. Later in the novel, these same devices might serve different purposes (conflict, climax, etc.).

**Misconception #2**: "Exposition is just boring background information"
**Correction**: Help students see that Lowry makes exposition engaging by embedding it in interesting family dynamics and mysterious community rules that create questions.

**Misconception #3**: "The devices work independently"
**Correction**: Show how Lowry often combines devices—direct dialogue might occur within a detailed scene while also revealing character traits.

**Misconception #4**: "Direct characterization is always better than indirect"
**Correction**: Explain that in exposition, direct characterization serves efficiency—Lowry needs to establish the story world quickly to get to the main conflict.

**Red Flag Responses**: Watch for students who focus on plot events rather than information delivery, or who can't explain *how* the device serves exposition specifically.
