## ANSWER KEY: LITERARY ANALYSIS WORKSHEET

### ENTRY ACTIVITY: COMPREHENSION CHECK

**Activity 1: Key Words**
Expected responses will vary but should include terms related to Exposition.

**Activity 2: Narrative Summary**
Students should identify major events in chronological order. Check for basic comprehension before proceeding to device analysis.

**Teacher Checkpoint:** If >80% struggle, re-read extract aloud before proceeding to Section 2.

---

## DEVICE 1: Direct Dialogue

### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Definition:** Characters' exact spoken words presented in quotation marks

**Model Example:** "Are you saying that I—I mean we—could do it again?"

---

### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Correct Answer:** Direct Dialogue

**Text Locations:**
{{DEVICE_1_EXAMPLE_LOCATIONS_FULL}}

**Sample Student Response:**
This is direct dialogue because it shows the character's exact words in quotation marks

**Teaching Note:** Emphasize that direct dialogue must include quotation marks and represent the character's exact words, not a summary of what they said

---

### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**Correct Answer:** B

**Rationale:** {{DEVICE_1_OPTION_RATIONALE}}

**Common Student Errors:**
- Selecting Option Internal monologue shows thoughts, not spoken dialogue in quotation marks: Students may confuse function with effect
- Selecting Option Indirect speech paraphrases what was said without using the exact words in quotes: Students may focus on literal content rather than device purpose

---

### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Correct Answer:** A, B, C

**Explanation:** First locate the dialogue markers, then identify the speaker, and finally examine the content's purpose in exposition

**Teaching Note:** If students struggle, guide them to look at the chronology of how the device unfolds in the text.

---

### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Sample Student Response:**
"{{DEVICE_1_DETAIL_SAMPLE}}"

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ✓ Specific reference to text (not vague)
- ✓ Directly supports the device usage
- ✓ Uses format: "shown through [specific detail]"

**Common Student Errors:**
- Writing a full quote instead of a paraphrased detail
- Being too vague (e.g., "shown through the writing")
- Describing effect instead of detail

---

### Step 6: CATEGORIZE THE EFFECT (STANDARD/HIGH TIER)

**Part A: Sorting Effects**

| Reader Response | Meaning Creation | Thematic Impact |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| {{DEVICE_1_READER_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_1_MEANING_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_1_THEMATIC_EFFECT_1}} |
| {{DEVICE_1_READER_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_1_MEANING_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_1_THEMATIC_EFFECT_2}} |

**Part B: Correct Category for This Device:** {{DEVICE_1_EFFECT_CATEGORY}}

**Correct Effect:** {{DEVICE_1_EFFECT_CORRECT}}

**Teaching Note:** Help students distinguish between how they feel (Reader Response), what they understand (Meaning Creation), and what themes emerge (Thematic Impact).

---

## DEVICE 2: Scene

### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Definition:** Detailed, real-time narration of important moments

**Model Example:** Jonas sobbed and shouted and pounded the bed with his fists

---

### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Correct Answer:** Scene

**Text Locations:**
{{DEVICE_2_EXAMPLE_LOCATIONS_FULL}}

**Sample Student Response:**
The author shows Jonas's emotional breakdown through specific actions like sobbing, shouting, and pounding, creating a scene that reveals his character in real-time

**Teaching Note:** Help students distinguish between 'showing' through scene and 'telling' through summary by comparing dramatic moments with background information passages

---

### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**Correct Answer:** B

**Rationale:** {{DEVICE_2_OPTION_RATIONALE}}

**Common Student Errors:**
- Selecting Option Option A describes summary narration, which tells rather than shows events in detail: {{DEVICE_2_ERROR_1}}
- Selecting Option Option C describes exposition through background information, but scene shows events happening in real-time rather than providing context: {{DEVICE_2_ERROR_2}}

---

### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Correct Answer:** A, B, C

**Explanation:** First locate the scene being dramatized, then examine the concrete details used to show it, and finally analyze how this scene contributes to revealing character or advancing the story's exposition

---

### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Sample Student Response:**
"{{DEVICE_2_DETAIL_SAMPLE}}"

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ✓ Specific reference to text
- ✓ Supports the device usage
- ✓ Uses correct format

---

### Step 6: CATEGORIZE THE EFFECT (STANDARD/HIGH TIER)

**Part A: Sorting Effects**

| Reader Response | Meaning Creation | Thematic Impact |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| {{DEVICE_2_READER_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_2_MEANING_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_2_THEMATIC_EFFECT_1}} |
| {{DEVICE_2_READER_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_2_MEANING_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_2_THEMATIC_EFFECT_2}} |

**Part B: Correct Category:** {{DEVICE_2_EFFECT_CATEGORY}}

**Correct Effect:** {{DEVICE_2_EFFECT_CORRECT}}

---

## DEVICE 3 (HIGH TIER ONLY): Indirect Characterization

### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Definition:** Revealing character traits through actions, thoughts, and dialogue rather than direct description

**Model Example:** Jonas thinking 'No. Wrong word, Jonas thought' shows his careful consideration of language and his developing awareness of precision in communication

---

### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Correct Answer:** Indirect Characterization

**Text Locations:**
{{DEVICE_3_EXAMPLE_LOCATIONS_FULL}}

**Sample Student Response:**
This shows Jonas is thoughtful and careful about choosing the right words

**Teaching Note:** Have students create character trait charts where they list character actions/thoughts in one column and the traits these reveal in another column

---

### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**Correct Answer:** B

**Rationale:** {{DEVICE_3_OPTION_RATIONALE}}

---

### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Correct Answer:** A, B, C

**Explanation:** You must first observe the character's behavior before you can analyze what it means, and only then can you understand how it fits into the story's development

---

### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Sample Student Response:**
"{{DEVICE_3_DETAIL_SAMPLE}}"

---

### Step 6: CATEGORIZE THE EFFECT

**Part A: Sorting Effects**

| Reader Response | Meaning Creation | Thematic Impact |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| {{DEVICE_3_READER_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_3_MEANING_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_3_THEMATIC_EFFECT_1}} |
| {{DEVICE_3_READER_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_3_MEANING_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_3_THEMATIC_EFFECT_2}} |

**Part B: Correct Category:** {{DEVICE_3_EFFECT_CATEGORY}}

**Correct Effect:** {{DEVICE_3_EFFECT_CORRECT}}

---

## ANSWER KEY: TVODE CONSTRUCTION WORKSHEET

### ACTIVITY 1: TOPIC STATEMENT

**Device 1: Direct Dialogue**
- **Correct Answer:** The author's use of Direct Dialogue
- **Where to find:** {{DEVICE_1_LOCATION_PROMPT}}

**Device 2: Scene**
- **Correct Answer:** The author's use of Scene
- **Where to find:** {{DEVICE_2_LOCATION_PROMPT}}

**Device 3 (High Tier): Indirect Characterization**
- **Correct Answer:** The author's use of Indirect Characterization
- **Where to find:** {{DEVICE_3_LOCATION_PROMPT}}

**Teaching Note:** Ensure all students complete topic frames before moving to Activity 2.

---

### ACTIVITY 2: MATCH OBJECTS

**Correct Matches:**
- **Device 1:** Direct Dialogue → **Object A:** {{DEVICE_1_OBJECT}}
- **Device 2:** Scene → **Object B:** {{DEVICE_2_OBJECT}}
- **Device 3 (High Tier):** Indirect Characterization → **Object C:** {{DEVICE_3_OBJECT}}

**Teaching Note:** Objects describe WHAT the device does, not WHY (that's the effect).

---

### ACTIVITY 3: INSERT VERB

**Suggested Verbs (accept reasonable alternatives):**

**Device 1:** The author's use of Direct Dialogue **{{DEVICE_1_VERB}}** {{DEVICE_1_OBJECT}}

**Device 2:** The author's use of Scene **{{DEVICE_2_VERB}}** {{DEVICE_2_OBJECT}}

**Device 3 (High Tier):** The author's use of Indirect Characterization **{{DEVICE_3_VERB}}** {{DEVICE_3_OBJECT}}

**Teaching Note:** Accept multiple verbs as long as they accurately connect Topic to Object. Most common acceptable verbs: uses, demonstrates, reveals, creates, employs.

---

### ACTIVITY 4: DETAIL AND EFFECT BANKS

**Details:**
- **Device 1:** {{DEVICE_1_DETAIL}}
- **Device 2:** {{DEVICE_2_DETAIL}}
- **Device 3 (High Tier):** {{DEVICE_3_DETAIL}}

**Effects:**
- **Device 1:** {{DEVICE_1_EFFECT}}
- **Device 2:** {{DEVICE_2_EFFECT}}
- **Device 3 (High Tier):** {{DEVICE_3_EFFECT}}

---

### ACTIVITY 5: DEVICE SUMMARY PARAGRAPH

**Device 1 Model Response:**

The direct dialogue "Are you saying that I—I mean we—could do it again?" reveals the speaker's uncertainty and desire through the hesitation and self-correction in their speech. The stammering "I—I mean we" shows the character catching themselves being selfish, exposing both their personal wants and awareness of others. This dialogue technique allows readers to understand the character's internal conflict without explicit narrator explanation, demonstrating how direct speech serves as efficient exposition. The questioning tone and repetitive possibility of action suggests this character has experienced something significant before and yearns to recreate it.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ✓ Begins with T+V+O sentence
- ✓ Integrates Detail using appropriate connector
- ✓ Integrates Effect using appropriate connector
- ✓ Includes 1-2 additional explanatory sentences
- ✓ Maintains focus on device function

**Common Student Errors:**
- Writing summary of plot instead of device analysis
- Missing TVODE components
- Too much description, not enough analysis

---

**Device 2 Model Response:**

The vivid scene where Jonas pounds the bed with emotional intensity operates as a dramatic moment that shows rather than tells his psychological state, directly revealing his character's breaking point and advancing the exposition about his internal struggle with the burden of memories.

**Evaluation Criteria:** Same as Device 1

---

**Device 3 Model Response (High Tier):**

The technique of indirect characterization reveals Jonas as a thoughtful and precise individual when he thinks 'No. Wrong word, Jonas thought,' which occurs throughout his interactions in Chapter 2, demonstrating his careful consideration of language, and establishing his character as someone who values accuracy and is developing a heightened awareness of communication that will become crucial to his role as the Receiver.

**Evaluation Criteria:** Same as Device 1

---

## ASSESSMENT RUBRIC

### TVODE Sentence Construction (Per Device)

| Criterion | Emerging (1-2) | Developing (3-4) | Proficient (5-6) | Advanced (7-8) |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Topic** | Device not identified or incorrect | Device identified but unclear | Device clearly identified | Device clearly identified with sophisticated framing |
| **Verb** | Missing or inappropriate | Generic verb (uses) | Appropriate action verb | Precise, varied verb choices |
| **Object** | Unclear or missing | Function stated but incomplete | Function clearly stated | Function clearly stated with nuance |
| **Detail** | Missing or vague | Present but generic | Specific textual reference | Specific, integrated textual evidence |
| **Effect** | Missing | Stated but unclear | Clear impact on meaning | Sophisticated analysis of impact |

**Target Scores:**
- **EAL Tier:** 15-20 points (Developing-Proficient)
- **Standard Tier:** 20-30 points (Proficient)
- **High Tier:** 30-40 points (Proficient-Advanced)

---

## COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS TO ADDRESS

### Literary Analysis Phase

**Misconception 1:** "The device IS the theme"
- **Correction:** Devices are tools the author uses; they're not the same as themes. The device helps reveal or develop the theme.

**Misconception 2:** "Any example from the text counts"
- **Correction:** The example must specifically show the device in action, not just mention related content.

**Misconception 3:** "Effect and Object are the same thing"
- **Correction:** Object = what the device does. Effect = the impact on meaning/reader.

### TVODE Construction Phase

**Misconception 1:** "TVODE should be 5 separate sentences"
- **Correction:** TVODE is ONE integrated sentence with all components connected.

**Misconception 2:** "Detail means any quote from the text"
- **Correction:** Detail should be specific evidence showing HOW the device works.

**Misconception 3:** "I can write TVODE in any order"
- **Correction:** The order matters: T→V→O→D→E creates logical flow.

## DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGIES

### For Struggling Students (EAL)
- Pre-teach device definitions before worksheet
- Provide sentence frames for all activities
- Allow pair work for Step 6 (Effect categorization)
- Focus on 1 device only, master it completely

### For Advanced Students (High Tier)
- Add 3rd device for additional challenge
- Require integration of multiple text examples
- Ask for comparison of device usage across different sections
- Challenge them to identify additional devices not on worksheet

### For Students with Identified Needs
- Provide pre-filled model examples
- Allow oral responses recorded by teacher/aide
- Simplify Step 6 to 2 categories instead of 3
- Use highlighted text with devices pre-identified
