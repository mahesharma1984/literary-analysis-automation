**Teacher Checkpoint:** If >80% struggle, re-read extract aloud before proceeding to Section 2.

---

## DEVICE 1: Precision of Language

### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Definition:** Careful selection of words to convey exact meaning and establish world-building

**Model Example:** Jonas was careful about language

---

### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Correct Answer:** Precision of Language

**Text Locations:**
{{DEVICE_1_EXAMPLE_LOCATIONS_FULL}}

**Sample Student Response:**
The author chooses exact words to show how strictly controlled language is in Jonas's society

**Teaching Note:** Emphasize that precision of language serves dual purposes: character development and world-building exposition

---

### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**Correct Answer:** B

**Rationale:** {{DEVICE_1_OPTION_RATIONALE}}

**Common Student Errors:**
- Selecting Option While the vocabulary may be sophisticated, the focus is not on showing intelligence but on establishing societal norms through careful word choice: Students may confuse function with effect
- Selecting Option The device is not about repetition for rhythm, but about the deliberate selection of precise words to convey exact meaning and build the world: Students may focus on literal content rather than device purpose

---

### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Correct Answer:** A, B, C

**Explanation:** Students must first locate the precise language, then understand its social implications, and finally assess its role in world-building and exposition

**Teaching Note:** If students struggle, guide them to look at the chronology of how the device unfolds in the text.

---

### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Sample Student Response:**
"{{DEVICE_1_DETAIL_SAMPLE}}"

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ✓ Specific reference to text (not vague)
- ✓ Directly supports the device usage
- ✓ Uses format: "shown through [specific detail]"

**Common Student Errors:**
- Writing a full quote instead of a paraphrased detail
- Being too vague (e.g., "shown through the writing")
- Describing effect instead of detail

---

### Step 6: CATEGORIZE THE EFFECT (STANDARD/HIGH TIER)

**Part A: Sorting Effects**

| Reader Response | Meaning Creation | Thematic Impact |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| {{DEVICE_1_READER_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_1_MEANING_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_1_THEMATIC_EFFECT_1}} |
| {{DEVICE_1_READER_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_1_MEANING_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_1_THEMATIC_EFFECT_2}} |

**Part B: Correct Category for This Device:** {{DEVICE_1_EFFECT_CATEGORY}}

**Correct Effect:** {{DEVICE_1_EFFECT_CORRECT}}

**Teaching Note:** Help students distinguish between how they feel (Reader Response), what they understand (Meaning Creation), and what themes emerge (Thematic Impact).

---

## DEVICE 2: Characterization through Speech Patterns

### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Definition:** Revealing character traits through distinctive ways of speaking

**Model Example:** Asher ran through the standard apology phrase rapidly, still catching his breath

---

### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Correct Answer:** Characterization through Speech Patterns

**Text Locations:**
{{DEVICE_2_EXAMPLE_LOCATIONS_FULL}}

**Sample Student Response:**
Asher's rapid, scrambled speech shows he is nervous and impulsive

**Teaching Note:** Have students practice reading dialogue aloud to hear how speech patterns sound and what they suggest about character

---

### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**Correct Answer:** B

**Rationale:** {{DEVICE_2_OPTION_RATIONALE}}

**Common Student Errors:**
- Selecting Option Option A focuses on setting exposition rather than character revelation through speech patterns: {{DEVICE_2_ERROR_1}}
- Selecting Option Option C describes mood creation through mysterious dialogue, not character traits revealed through distinctive speech habits: {{DEVICE_2_ERROR_2}}

---

### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Correct Answer:** A, B, C

**Explanation:** Students must first notice the specific speech pattern, then interpret what it reveals about character, and finally understand how this character information serves the exposition's purpose of introducing key figures in the story

---

### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Sample Student Response:**
"{{DEVICE_2_DETAIL_SAMPLE}}"

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ✓ Specific reference to text
- ✓ Supports the device usage
- ✓ Uses correct format

---

### Step 6: CATEGORIZE THE EFFECT (STANDARD/HIGH TIER)

**Part A: Sorting Effects**

| Reader Response | Meaning Creation | Thematic Impact |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| {{DEVICE_2_READER_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_2_MEANING_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_2_THEMATIC_EFFECT_1}} |
| {{DEVICE_2_READER_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_2_MEANING_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_2_THEMATIC_EFFECT_2}} |

**Part B: Correct Category:** {{DEVICE_2_EFFECT_CATEGORY}}

**Correct Effect:** {{DEVICE_2_EFFECT_CORRECT}}

---

## DEVICE 3 (HIGH TIER ONLY): Internal Monologue

### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Definition:** Character's private thoughts revealed to show internal state

**Model Example:** he wasn't frightened, but he was... eager, he decided

---

### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Correct Answer:** Internal Monologue

**Text Locations:**
{{DEVICE_3_EXAMPLE_LOCATIONS_FULL}}

**Sample Student Response:**
This shows the character's private thoughts as he tries to identify his feelings about a situation

**Teaching Note:** Emphasize that internal monologue gives readers special access to thoughts that other characters cannot hear

---

### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**Correct Answer:** B

**Rationale:** {{DEVICE_3_OPTION_RATIONALE}}

---

### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Correct Answer:** A, B, C

**Explanation:** This order moves from basic identification to deeper analysis, first establishing who is thinking, then what those thoughts reveal, and finally how they function in the larger narrative

---

### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Sample Student Response:**
"{{DEVICE_3_DETAIL_SAMPLE}}"

---

### Step 6: CATEGORIZE THE EFFECT

**Part A: Sorting Effects**

| Reader Response | Meaning Creation | Thematic Impact |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| {{DEVICE_3_READER_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_3_MEANING_EFFECT_1}} | {{DEVICE_3_THEMATIC_EFFECT_1}} |
| {{DEVICE_3_READER_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_3_MEANING_EFFECT_2}} | {{DEVICE_3_THEMATIC_EFFECT_2}} |

**Part B: Correct Category:** {{DEVICE_3_EFFECT_CATEGORY}}

**Correct Effect:** {{DEVICE_3_EFFECT_CORRECT}}

---

## ANSWER KEY: TVODE CONSTRUCTION WORKSHEET

### ACTIVITY 5: DEVICE SUMMARY PARAGRAPH

**Device 1 Model Response:**

The author uses precision of language when stating 'Jonas was careful about language' to reveal that this society has strict rules about word choice, demonstrating through Jonas's cautious behavior that citizens must constantly monitor their speech, which establishes the controlled and regulated nature of this dystopian world early in the exposition.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ✓ Begins with T+V+O sentence
- ✓ Integrates Detail using appropriate connector
- ✓ Integrates Effect using appropriate connector
- ✓ Includes 1-2 additional explanatory sentences
- ✓ Maintains focus on device function

**Common Student Errors:**
- Writing summary of plot instead of device analysis
- Missing TVODE components
- Too much description, not enough analysis

---

**Device 2 Model Response:**

The author characterizes Asher as nervous and impulsive by describing how he 'ran through the standard apology phrase rapidly' and 'talked too fast and mixed things up, scrambling words and phrases,' which reveals his anxious personality and suggests he may struggle with the community's emphasis on precision, demonstrating how speech patterns efficiently introduce character traits during the story's exposition.

**Evaluation Criteria:** Same as Device 1

---

**Device 3 Model Response (High Tier):**

The internal monologue 'he wasn't frightened, but he was... eager, he decided' reveals the character's attempt to understand his own complex emotions through private self-reflection. The ellipsis and hesitant phrasing shows his uncertainty about his feelings. This technique allows readers direct access to his psychological state. The device functions as exposition by establishing his emotional readiness for upcoming events. Through this internal dialogue, the author builds anticipation while developing character depth.

**Evaluation Criteria:** Same as Device 1

---

## ASSESSMENT RUBRIC

### TVODE Sentence Construction (Per Device)

| Criterion | Emerging (1-2) | Developing (3-4) | Proficient (5-6) | Advanced (7-8) |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Topic** | Device not identified or incorrect | Device identified but unclear | Device clearly identified | Device clearly identified with sophisticated framing |
| **Verb** | Missing or inappropriate | Generic verb (uses) | Appropriate action verb | Precise, varied verb choices |
| **Object** | Unclear or missing | Function stated but incomplete | Function clearly stated | Function clearly stated with nuance |
| **Detail** | Missing or vague | Present but generic | Specific textual reference | Specific, integrated textual evidence |
| **Effect** | Missing | Stated but unclear | Clear impact on meaning | Sophisticated analysis of impact |

**Target Scores:**
- **EAL Tier:** 15-20 points (Developing-Proficient)
- **Standard Tier:** 20-30 points (Proficient)
- **High Tier:** 30-40 points (Proficient-Advanced)

---

## COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS TO ADDRESS

### Literary Analysis Phase

**Misconception 1:** "The device IS the theme"
- **Correction:** Devices are tools the author uses; they're not the same as themes. The device helps reveal or develop the theme.

**Misconception 2:** "Any example from the text counts"
- **Correction:** The example must specifically show the device in action, not just mention related content.

**Misconception 3:** "Effect and Object are the same thing"
- **Correction:** Object = what the device does. Effect = the impact on meaning/reader.

### TVODE Construction Phase

**Misconception 1:** "TVODE should be 5 separate sentences"
- **Correction:** TVODE is ONE integrated sentence with all components connected.

**Misconception 2:** "Detail means any quote from the text"
- **Correction:** Detail should be specific evidence showing HOW the device works.

**Misconception 3:** "I can write TVODE in any order"
- **Correction:** The order matters: T→V→O→D→E creates logical flow.

## DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGIES

### For Struggling Students (EAL)
- Pre-teach device definitions before worksheet
- Provide sentence frames for all activities
- Allow pair work for Step 6 (Effect categorization)
- Focus on 1 device only, master it completely

### For Advanced Students (High Tier)
- Add 3rd device for additional challenge
- Require integration of multiple text examples
- Ask for comparison of device usage across different sections
- Challenge them to identify additional devices not on worksheet

### For Students with Identified Needs
- Provide pre-filled model examples
- Allow oral responses recorded by teacher/aide
- Simplify Step 6 to 2 categories instead of 3
- Use highlighted text with devices pre-identified
