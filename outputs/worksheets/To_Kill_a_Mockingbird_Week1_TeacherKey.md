# TEACHER ANSWER KEY: Week 1 - Exposition in To Kill a Mockingbird

**Chapter Focus:** Chapter 1 (Primary exposition chapter)

---

## TEACHING NOTES

**Introducing Exposition:**
- Begin by explaining that exposition is the "setup" of a story—where readers learn essential background information
- Emphasize that Harper Lee uses Chapter 1 to establish Maycomb's social hierarchy, the Finch family dynamics, and historical context
- Connect to students' prior knowledge: "What do you need to know before understanding any story?"

**Macro-Micro Connection:**
- Help students see that characterization devices *serve* the exposition—they're tools Lee uses to efficiently establish her world
- Use the analogy of a movie's opening scene: every detail is carefully chosen to set up the story
- Remind students that good exposition feels natural, not like an information dump

## SECTION 3: SAMPLE TVODE SENTENCES

1. **Harper Lee uses direct characterization in her exposition to efficiently establish Maycomb's social hierarchy, directly stating that Atticus "was related by blood or marriage to nearly every family in the town," which immediately positions the Finch family within the community's power structure.**

2. **Through indirect characterization during the exposition, Lee reveals Scout's naivety and curiosity as she recounts childhood fascination with Boo Radley, allowing readers to understand the children's innocence before the story's darker themes emerge.**

3. **Lee's combination of direct and indirect characterization in Chapter 1 creates comprehensive exposition that both informs readers about Maycomb's social dynamics and engages them in understanding the complex relationships that will drive the novel's central conflicts.**

## COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS

**Misconception 1:** *"Exposition is boring/just background information"*
**Address by:** Show how Lee makes exposition engaging through Scout's narrative voice and interesting details about the town's quirks.

**Misconception 2:** *"Direct characterization is always better because it's clearer"*
**Address by:** Explain that good authors use both strategically—direct for efficiency, indirect for engagement and complexity.

**Misconception 3:** *"All Chapter 1 information is exposition"*
**Address by:** Help students distinguish between essential background information and atmospheric details that serve other purposes.

**Misconception 4:** *"These devices work independently"*
**Address by:** Emphasize how both characterization types work together to serve the larger purpose of exposition—they're tools with a job to do.

**Teaching Tip:** If students struggle to find examples, guide them to specific passages rather than letting them flounder. The goal is understanding the concept, not frustrating treasure hunts.
