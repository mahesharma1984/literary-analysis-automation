# To Kill a Mockingbird - Week 3 Teacher Answer Key

**Macro Focus:** Structure

# TEACHER ANSWER KEY - WEEK 3: STRUCTURE
## Text: To Kill a Mockingbird | Focus: Foreshadowing & Motif

---

## TEACHING NOTES

**Introducing Structure**: Begin by explaining that structure is the "architecture" of a story—how authors organize events, reveals, and patterns to create meaning. Unlike plot (what happens), structure is about *how* and *when* things happen.

**Macro-Micro Connection**: Help students see that foreshadowing creates suspense and anticipation throughout the entire narrative, while motifs create thematic coherence by repeating key images/ideas. Both devices work across the whole novel, not just in individual scenes.

**Facilitation Tip**: Use the metaphor of a building—foreshadowing is like laying foundation stones that support what comes later, while motifs are like architectural elements (arches, columns) that appear throughout to create unity.

## SECTION 1: COMPREHENSION CHECK

### Entry Activity 1: Structure Awareness
**Expected Response**: Students should identify that Harper Lee structures the novel in two main parts—childhood experiences (Part 1) and the trial (Part 2)—with the Boo Radley mystery framing both sections. The structure moves from childhood innocence to moral awakening.

### Entry Activity 2: Chapter Recall
**Expected Response**: Students should demonstrate understanding of key events from recent chapters, particularly moments that seem to "point forward" to future events or repeat important symbols/themes they've seen before.

## SECTION 2: DEVICE ANALYSIS ANSWERS

### FORESHADOWING

**Step 2: Text Example**
- **Strong Student Response**: Mrs. Dubose's comment about Atticus "lawing for niggers" or the rabid dog incident (Tim Johnson) hinting at Atticus's moral courage
- **Alternative Examples**: Aunt Alexandra's concerns about the family name, or early mentions of the Cunninghams and Ewells

**Step 3: Multiple Choice**
**Correct Answer: C** - Foreshadowing creates anticipation by hinting at future conflicts
*Explanation*: Foreshadowing's primary structural function is building suspense and preparing readers for major events.

**Step 4: Sequence Activity**
**Correct Order: 1-C, 2-A, 3-B**
- Hint is planted → Reader anticipation builds → Event occurs with greater impact

**Step 5: Textual Detail**
**Example Response**: "The word 'nigger-lover' is mentioned early when Mrs. Dubose says it, foreshadowing how this accusation will become central during the trial."

**Step 6: Categorization**
**Correct Effect: Builds Suspense/Tension**
*Explanation*: Most foreshadowing examples create anticipation about upcoming conflicts, particularly around the trial and racial tensions.

### MOTIF

**Step 2: Text Example**
- **Strong Student Response**: The mockingbird motif (innocence that shouldn't be harmed) or the motif of "seeing" and blindness/prejudice
- **Alternative Examples**: Items left in the tree (connection/communication), or references to courage

**Step 3: Multiple Choice**
**Correct Answer: B** - A motif is a recurring element that develops theme
*Explanation*: Unlike symbols (which represent something else), motifs are patterns that reinforce the novel's central messages.

**Step 4: Sequence Activity**
**Correct Order: 1-B, 2-C, 3-A**
- Element appears → Pattern of repetition develops → Theme becomes clearer

**Step 5: Textual Detail**
**Example Response**: "The mockingbird appears when Atticus says it's a sin to kill one, when Mr. Underwood compares Tom's death to killing a mockingbird, and in the title itself."

**Step 6: Categorization**
**Correct Effect: Reinforces Theme**
*Explanation*: Motifs work primarily to strengthen thematic understanding through repetition and variation.

## SECTION 3: SAMPLE TVODE SENTENCES

1. **Foreshadowing Example**: "Harper Lee structures the early chapters with foreshadowing of racial conflict, as when Mrs. Dubose calls Atticus a 'nigger-lover,' which creates anticipation for the central trial and demonstrates how personal attacks on moral courage build dramatic tension."

2. **Motif Example**: "The structural repetition of the mockingbird motif throughout *To Kill a Mockingbird* reinforces the theme of protecting innocence, as Lee weaves references from Atticus's advice through Tom Robinson's fate to create thematic unity across the novel's two-part structure."

3. **Combined Example**: "Lee's careful structural placement of both foreshadowing and motifs creates a narrative that builds toward the trial while consistently developing themes of moral courage, showing how individual scenes connect to the novel's larger examination of justice and prejudice."

## COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS

### Misconception 1: "Foreshadowing is just coincidence"
**Correction**: Emphasize that foreshadowing is *intentional* author craft. If students identify coincidences, ask them to consider whether the author placed these details deliberately to prepare readers.

### Misconception 2: "Any repeated word is a motif"
**Correction**: Motifs must develop *meaning*, not just appear multiple times. Guide students to ask: "How does each repetition add to or change our understanding of the theme?"

### Misconception 3: "Structure is just the order of events"
**Correction**: Structure is about *why* authors choose specific ordering, pacing, and placement. Help students move from "what happens when" to "why does the author reveal this information now?"

### Misconception 4: "Foreshadowing gives away the ending"
**Correction**: Good foreshadowing creates anticipation without spoiling surprises. It prepares readers emotionally and thematically rather than revealing exact plot points.

**Assessment Tip**: If students struggle with these devices, return to concrete examples and have them trace one clear instance through multiple appearances before attempting complex analysis.
