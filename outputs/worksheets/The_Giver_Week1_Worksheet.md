## SECTION 2: DEVICE ANALYSIS (Building TVODE Components)

**Note to Students:** The answers you create in this section will become parts of your analytical sentence in the TVODE worksheet.

---

### DEVICE 1: Direct Dialogue

#### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Direct Dialogue is:**

Characters' exact spoken words presented in quotation marks

**Example from model:** "Are you saying that I—I mean we—could do it again?"

---

#### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Your Turn:** Find an example of **Direct Dialogue** in *The Giver*.

**Where to look:**
Find the dialogue in quotation marks where a character asks about repeating an action

**My Example:**

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **TOPIC** - the device you will analyze.

---

**Teacher Checkpoint:** Did students complete matching BEFORE moving to multiple choice? ☐ Yes ☐ No  
*(If No, STOP. Process breakdown - return to matching.)*

---

#### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**What does Direct Dialogue DO in this text? What is its purpose or function?**

**A)** Characters' thoughts revealed through internal monologue  
**B)** Characters' exact spoken words presented in quotation marks  
**C)** Narrator's description of what characters said without quotes  
**D)** Author's commentary on characters' speech patterns

**Your Answer:** ______

**TVODE Note:** This is your **OBJECT** - what the device does or shows in the text.

**Design Note:** Answers describe function/purpose (WHAT the device does), not effect (WHY). Two options should be "quite possible." All answers should be the same length, a single clause; don't use complex sentences for answers. Make sure you randomize multiple choice answers across questions for device 1, 2, 3, etc.

---

#### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Put these details in order to show HOW Direct Dialogue is used in the text.**

**A)** Identify the quotation marks that signal direct speech  
**B)** Determine which character is speaking the quoted words  
**C)** Analyze what information the dialogue reveals to readers

**Your Answer:** 1-___ , 2-___ , 3-___

**Teacher Note:** Answers should be RANDOMIZED (not 1-2-3 order). Correct answer format: "1-B, 2-A, 3-C"

---

#### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Now that you understand HOW the device works, write the specific detail from the text that best shows this.**

Use this format: "shown through [specific detail/example from text]"

Your Detail:

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **DETAIL** - the specific textual evidence that supports your analysis.

**Teacher Note:** Students should write a phrase/short sentence based on their sequencing understanding. This becomes the Detail component of TVODE.

#### Step 6 (STANDARD/HIGH TIER): CATEGORIZE THE EFFECT

**Part A: Sort ALL the effects into categories**

Read these possible effects and write EACH ONE in the correct category box below:

**Effects to Sort:**
1. Direct dialogue conveys information through characters' own words rather than narrator summary, making exposition feel more natural and immediate

3. Characters' spoken words can directly state or hint at central themes through their own perspectives and concerns
4. Speech patterns, word choice, and topics reveal personality traits, education level, emotions, and relationships between speakers
5. Dialogue advances story by revealing background information, establishing conflicts, and showing character motivations naturally
6. Direct dialogue breaks up narrative exposition, creating dynamic pacing and multiple narrative voices within the text

**Category Definitions:**
- **Reader Response:** How the device affects what readers feel or experience
- **Meaning Creation:** How the device builds understanding or reveals ideas
- **Thematic Impact:** How the device connects to the text's bigger message or theme
