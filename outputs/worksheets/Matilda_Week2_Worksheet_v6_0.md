## PART A: THESIS ALIGNMENT

**Purpose:** Understand how this week's focus connects to the text's overall meaning

### The Text's Overall Thesis

Text Selection: "Matilda" represents a paradigmatic example of children's literature that operates on multiple developmental levels simultaneously. The novel follows five-year-old Matilda Wormwood, a brilliant child born to neglectful parents, who discovers her telekinetic powers while navigating hostile environments at home and school.

**Key Elements:**

- **Narrative Voice:** Narrative Voice and Tone Management
Device Function: Dahl's narrator shifts between adult sophistication and child-like directness, creating complicity with young readers while maintaining analytic...
- **Structure:** structures that suppress children's potential
- **Rhetorical Strategy:** Alignment Pattern

Text Selection: "Matilda" represents a paradigmatic example of children's literature that operates on multiple developmental levels simultaneously

### This Week's Role in the Thesis

**Chapter Function:** Rising_action

**Dramatic Purpose:** tension between individual empowerment and institutional oppression. This pattern manifests through Matilda's journey from powerless victim to self-actualized agent of justice, consistently challenging adult authority structures that suppress children's potential

**Thematic Connection:**

- Devices in this section work together to establish the rising_action function
- The rising_action section connects to the text's central themes through device usage
- These devices build meaning that supports the overall narrative purpose

**What to Notice:**

1. Literary devices like Dialogue, Direct Characterization work together to build tension and escalate conflict
2. Devices maintain narrative coherence while fulfilling the rising_action function
3. Devices build meaning that connects to the text's overall exploration of its central themes

## SECTION 2: DEVICE ANALYSIS (Building TVODE Components)

**Note to Students:** The answers you create in this section will become parts of your analytical sentence in the TVODE worksheet.

---

### DEVICE 1: Dialogue

#### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Dialogue is:**

Direct speech between characters that reveals personality and advances plot

**Example from model:** 'You can rely on us,' Lavender said

---

#### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Your Turn:** Find an example of **Dialogue** in *Matilda*.

**Where to look:**
Chapter 8, when Matilda first arrives at school and other students warn her

**My Example:**

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **TOPIC** - the device you will analyze.

---

**Teacher Checkpoint:** Did students complete matching BEFORE moving to multiple choice? ☐ Yes ☐ No  
*(If No, STOP. Process breakdown - return to matching.)*

---

#### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**What does Dialogue DO in this text? What is its purpose or function?**

**A)** Shows how students bond together through shared academic interests and classroom discussions  
**B)** Reveals the depth of fear students feel toward Miss Trunchbull's brutal methods  
**C)** Demonstrates how children communicate secretly to avoid detection by school authorities  
**D)** Explains the specific rules and regulations that govern behavior at Crunchem Hall

**Your Answer:** ______

**TVODE Note:** This is your **OBJECT** - what the device does or shows in the text.

**Design Note:** Answers describe function/purpose (WHAT the device does), not effect (WHY). Two options should be "quite possible." All four options must be similar length (one clause each, roughly 10-15 words). Avoid making the correct answer noticeably longer or more specific than distractors. Randomize correct answer position across devices (don't always make B correct).

---

#### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Put these details in order to show HOW Dialogue is used in the text.**

**A)** Reader encounters Lavender's seemingly simple promise of support to Matilda in Chapter 8  
**B)** The dialogue transforms from reassurance into evidence of how normalized school violence has become  
**C)** Reader realizes the extent of institutional abuse and feels growing dread about Matilda's future

**Your Answer:** 1-___ , 2-___ , 3-___



**Teacher Note:** When generating worksheets, RANDOMIZE the order of options A, B, C so the correct sequence is NOT 1-A, 2-B, 3-C. Example correct answers: "1-C, 2-A, 3-B" or "1-B, 2-C, 3-A"

---

#### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Now that you understand HOW the device works, write the specific detail from the text that best shows this.**

Use this format: "shown through [specific detail/example from text]"

Your Detail:

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **DETAIL** - the specific textual evidence that supports your analysis.

**Teacher Note:** Students should write a phrase/short sentence based on their sequencing understanding. This becomes the Detail component of TVODE.

---

#### Step 6 (STANDARD/HIGH TIER): EFFECTS AND INSIGHTS

**Part A: Sort the Effects**

Read these effects and sort them into the three categories below.

**Tip:** Look for signal words:
- **What I Felt** → feeling words (uneasy, curious, tense, surprised)
- **What I Understood** → "shows," "reveals," "we learn," "tells us"
- **Big Idea** → "theme," "message," "the author is saying"

**Effects to Sort:**
1. Creates growing dread and anxiety about what Matilda will face at school
2. Exposes how normalized violence has become within the school system
3. Establishes the theme of children protecting each other against adult tyranny
4. 
5.
