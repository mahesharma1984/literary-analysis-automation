Text Selection: "Matilda" represents a paradigmatic example of children's literature that operates on multiple developmental levels simultaneously

### This Week's Role in the Thesis

**Chapter Function:** Exposition

**Dramatic Purpose:** These opening chapters introduce the main characters, setting, and initial circumstances. This establishes the foundation for the central conflict and themes that will drive the entire narrative.

**Thematic Connection:**

- Devices in this section work together to establish the exposition function
- The exposition section connects to the text's central themes through device usage
- These devices build meaning that supports the overall narrative purpose

**What to Notice:**

1. Literary devices like Hyperbole, Metaphor work together to establish characters, setting, and initial circumstances
2. Devices maintain narrative coherence while fulfilling the exposition function
3. Devices build meaning that connects to the text's overall exploration of its central themes

## SECTION 2: DEVICE ANALYSIS (Building TVODE Components)

**Note to Students:** The answers you create in this section will become parts of your analytical sentence in the TVODE worksheet.

---

### DEVICE 1: Hyperbole

#### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**Hyperbole is:**

Deliberate and obvious exaggeration for emphasis or dramatic effect

**Example from model:** the most disgusting little blister you could ever imagine

---

#### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Your Turn:** Find an example of **Hyperbole** in *Matilda*.

**Where to look:**
Chapter 1, when the narrator introduces the Wormwood family and describes parental delusions

**My Example:**

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **TOPIC** - the device you will analyze.

---

**Teacher Checkpoint:** Did students complete matching BEFORE moving to multiple choice? ☐ Yes ☐ No  
*(If No, STOP. Process breakdown - return to matching.)*

---

#### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**What does Hyperbole DO in this text? What is its purpose or function?**

**A)** Shows how Mr. Wormwood genuinely believes Michael is academically gifted and brilliant  
**B)** Reveals the complete disconnect between parents' perceptions and their children's reality  
**C)** Demonstrates how parents become delusionally blind to their children's obvious flaws  
**D)** Illustrates how Michael's appearance actually matches his father's harsh description

**Your Answer:** ______

**TVODE Note:** This is your **OBJECT** - what the device does or shows in the text.

**Design Note:** Answers describe function/purpose (WHAT the device does), not effect (WHY). Two options should be "quite possible." All four options must be similar length (one clause each, roughly 10-15 words). Avoid making the correct answer noticeably longer or more specific than distractors. Randomize correct answer position across devices (don't always make B correct).

---

#### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Put these details in order to show HOW Hyperbole is used in the text.**

**A)** Reader encounters Mr. Wormwood's shocking description of Michael as 'the most disgusting little blister you could ever imagine' in Chapter 1  
**B)** The extreme language transforms a parent's criticism into absurd comedy, making readers recognize familiar parental blindness  
**C)** Reader laughs while understanding how completely parents can deceive themselves about their children's qualities

**Your Answer:** 1-___ , 2-___ , 3-___



**Teacher Note:** When generating worksheets, RANDOMIZE the order of options A, B, C so the correct sequence is NOT 1-A, 2-B, 3-C. Example correct answers: "1-C, 2-A, 3-B" or "1-B, 2-C, 3-A"

---

#### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Now that you understand HOW the device works, write the specific detail from the text that best shows this.**

Use this format: "shown through [specific detail/example from text]"

Your Detail:

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **DETAIL** - the specific textual evidence that supports your analysis.

**Teacher Note:** Students should write a phrase/short sentence based on their sequencing understanding. This becomes the Detail component of TVODE.

---

#### Step 6 (STANDARD/HIGH TIER): EFFECTS AND INSIGHTS

**Part A: Sort the Effects**

Read these effects and sort them into the three categories below.

**Tip:** Look for signal words:
- **What I Felt** → feeling words (uneasy, curious, tense, surprised)
- **What I Understood** → "shows," "reveals," "we learn," "tells us"
- **Big Idea** → "theme," "message," "the author is saying"

**Effects to Sort:**
1. Creates immediate humor and recognition of familiar parental behavior
2. Reveals how completely parents can be blinded by love for their children
3. Establishes the theme of adults failing to see children objectively
4. 
5.

---

#### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)
