# THE GIVER INTEGRATED MACRO-MICRO PROGRESSION
## 5-Week Literary Analysis Curriculum

**Text:** The Giver by Lois Lowry  
**Version:** 5.1 (Chapter-Aware)  
**Date:** November 24, 2025  
**Structure:** Macro alignment elements taught through executing micro devices

---

## CURRICULUM OVERVIEW

### Pedagogical Approach

This curriculum teaches **macro alignment elements** (Exposition, Structure, Voice) through the **micro devices** that execute them, rather than teaching devices in isolation.

**Core Principle:** Literary concepts like "exposition" are not abstract ideasâ€”they manifest through specific devices working together. Students learn to see how macro elements OPERATE through micro techniques.

### 5-Week Progression

| Week | Macro Focus | Teaching Approach | Devices | Scaffolding |
|------|-------------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Exposition | How do devices establish characters and setting in exposition? | Precision of Language, Characterization through Speech Patterns, Internal Monologue, +1 more | High - Teacher models everything |
| 2 | Rising Action | How do devices build tension in rising action? | Dramatic Irony, Escalating Formality, Euphemistic Language, +1 more | Medium-High - Co-construction with students |
| 3 | Structure/Climax | How do devices create the story's climactic turning point? | Pivotal Dialogue, Symbolic Action, Intimate Whispers, +1 more | Medium - Students lead with support |
| 4 | Voice/Falling Action | How do devices manage perspective in falling action? | Sensory Deterioration, Diminishing Threat Language, Environmental Transformation, +1 more | Medium-Low - Independent work with feedback |
| 5 | Resolution | How do devices bring rhetorical closure in resolution? | Cyclical Memory Structure, Community Integration Language, Dialect Characterization, +1 more | Low - Independent synthesis and analysis |

## WEEK 1: EXPOSITION

**Macro Concept:** How characters and setting are introduced
**Teaching Goal:** Understanding how exposition is built through devices
**Scaffolding:** High - Teacher models everything

**Teaching Sequence:**
1. Introduce concept of literary devices as author's tools
2. Define exposition and its components
3. Practice identifying exposition devices in text together
4. Explain what each device accomplishes
5. Begin simple TVODE construction

**Devices (4):**
- **Precision of Language**: 
- **Characterization through Speech Patterns**: 
- **Internal Monologue**: 
- **Ritual Language Patterns**: 

**Macro Variables:**
- characterization_method: IND
- mode_dominance: BAL
- mode_description:

## WEEK 2: RISING ACTION

**Macro Element:** How conflict and tension develop through literary devices
**Teaching Goal:** Understanding rising action and device recognition
**Scaffolding:** Medium-High - Co-construction with students

**Teaching Sequence:**
1. Review Week 1 exposition devices
2. Introduce macro concept: Literary Devices Foundation
3. Show how devices BUILD meaning through figurative language
4. Analyze device-macro connection in text
5. Practice macro-micro TVODE construction

**Devices (4):**
- **Dramatic Irony**: 
- **Escalating Formality**: 
- **Euphemistic Language**: 
- **Foreshadowing through Uncertainty**:

## WEEK 3: STRUCTURE/CLIMAX

**Macro Element:** How plot is organized and paced
**Teaching Goal:** Understanding how structure and climax work through devices
**Scaffolding:** Medium - Students lead with support

**Teaching Sequence:**
1. Review exposition and rising action concepts
2. Introduce macro concept: Structure and Climax
3. Analyze how devices create plot structure and turning points
4. Trace structural patterns across chapters
5. Build complex structural TVODE

**Devices (4):**
- **Pivotal Dialogue**: 
- **Symbolic Action**: 
- **Intimate Whispers**: 
- **Internal Transformation Language**: 

**Macro Variables:**
- plot_architecture: MONO
- chronology: LIN
- causation: STRONG
- pacing_dominance:

## WEEK 4: VOICE/FALLING ACTION

**Macro Element:** Narrative perspective and narration
**Teaching Goal:** Understanding how narrative voice operates through devices
**Scaffolding:** Medium-Low - Independent work with feedback

**Teaching Sequence:**
1. Review structural concepts from Week 3
2. Introduce macro concept: Voice and Falling Action
3. Analyze perspective and distance through devices
4. Compare macro-micro relationships across weeks
5. Create voice-focused analysis TVODE

**Devices (4):**
- **Sensory Deterioration**: 
- **Diminishing Threat Language**: 
- **Environmental Transformation**: 
- **Responsibility Awareness**: 

**Macro Variables:**
- pov: TPL
- focalization: INT
- reliability: REL
- temporal_distance: IMM

## WEEK 5: RESOLUTION

**Macro Element:** How conflicts resolve and themes culminate
**Teaching Goal:** Understanding resolution and synthesizing all concepts
**Scaffolding:** Low - Independent synthesis and analysis

**Teaching Sequence:**
1. Synthesize all previous concepts (Exposition, Rising Action, Structure, Voice)
2. Introduce macro concept: Resolution
3. Analyze how all devices work together to create resolution
4. Demonstrate understanding of complete narrative arc
5. Create independent comprehensive analysis TVODE

**Devices (4):**
- **Cyclical Memory Structure**: 
- **Community Integration Language**: 
- **Dialect Characterization**: 
- **Spiritual Imagery**:
