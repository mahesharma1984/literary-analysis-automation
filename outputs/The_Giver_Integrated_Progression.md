# THE GIVER INTEGRATED MACRO-MICRO PROGRESSION
## 5-Week Literary Analysis Curriculum

**Text:** The Giver by Lois Lowry  
**Version:** 5.0 (Macro-Micro Integration)  
**Date:** November 21, 2025  
**Structure:** Macro alignment elements taught through executing micro devices

---

## CURRICULUM OVERVIEW

### Pedagogical Approach

This curriculum teaches **macro alignment elements** (Exposition, Structure, Voice) through the **micro devices** that execute them, rather than teaching devices in isolation.

**Core Principle:** Literary concepts like "exposition" are not abstract ideasâ€”they manifest through specific devices working together. Students learn to see how macro elements OPERATE through micro techniques.

### 5-Week Progression

| Week | Macro Focus | Teaching Approach | Devices | Scaffolding |
|------|-------------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Exposition | How do devices establish characters and setting in exposition? | Direct Dialogue, Scene, Indirect Characterization | High - Teacher models everything |
| 2 | Literary Devices | How do devices build tension in rising action? | Symbolism, Metaphor, Imagery, +2 more | Medium-High - Co-construction with students |
| 3 | Structure | How do devices create the story's climactic turning point? | Foreshadowing, Climactic Structure | Medium - Students lead with support |
| 4 | Narrative Voice | How do devices manage perspective in falling action? | Third-Person Limited Narration, Internal Monologue | Medium-Low - Independent work with feedback |
| 5 | Rhetorical Voice | How do devices bring rhetorical closure in resolution? | Dramatic Irony, Repetition, Juxtaposition | Low - Independent synthesis and analysis |

## WEEK 1: EXPOSITION

**Macro Concept:** How characters and setting are introduced
**Teaching Goal:** Understanding how exposition is built through devices
**Scaffolding:** High - Teacher models everything

**Teaching Sequence:**
1. Introduce concept of literary devices as author's tools
2. Define specific devices with clear examples
3. Practice identifying devices in text together
4. Explain what each device accomplishes
5. Begin simple TVODE construction

**Devices (3):**
- **Direct Dialogue**: 
- **Scene**: 
- **Indirect Characterization**: 

**Macro Variables:**
- characterization_method: 
- mode_dominance: 
- mode_description:

## WEEK 2: LITERARY DEVICES

**Macro Element:** Foundational figurative language and descriptive devices
**Teaching Goal:** Device recognition and identification
**Scaffolding:** Medium-High - Co-construction with students

**Teaching Sequence:**
1. Review Week 1 foundation devices
2. Introduce macro concept: Rising Action
3. Show how devices BUILD rising action and tension
4. Analyze device-macro connection in text
5. Practice macro-micro TVODE construction

**Devices (5):**
- **Symbolism**: 
- **Metaphor**: 
- **Imagery**: 
- **Personification**: 
- **Alliteration**:

## WEEK 3: STRUCTURE

**Macro Element:** How plot is organized and paced
**Teaching Goal:** Understanding how structure unfolds through devices
**Scaffolding:** Medium - Students lead with support

**Teaching Sequence:**
1. Review exposition and rising action concepts
2. Introduce macro concept: Structure and Climax
3. Analyze how devices create plot structure and turning points
4. Trace structural patterns across chapters
5. Build complex structural TVODE

**Devices (2):**
- **Foreshadowing**: 
- **Climactic Structure**: 

**Macro Variables:**
- plot_architecture: 
- chronology: 
- causation: 
- pacing_dominance:

## WEEK 4: NARRATIVE VOICE

**Macro Element:** Point of view, focalization, and character consciousness
**Teaching Goal:** Understanding perspective and consciousness
**Scaffolding:** Medium-Low - Independent work with feedback

**Teaching Sequence:**
1. Review structural concepts from Week 3
2. Introduce macro concept: Voice and Falling Action
3. Analyze perspective and distance through devices
4. Compare macro-micro relationships across weeks
5. Create voice-focused analysis TVODE

**Devices (2):**
- **Third-Person Limited Narration**: 
- **Internal Monologue**: 

**Macro Variables:**
- pov: 
- focalization: 
- reliability: 
- temporal_distance:

## WEEK 5: RHETORICAL VOICE

**Macro Element:** Irony, persuasion, and interpretive control
**Teaching Goal:** Understanding irony and persuasive techniques
**Scaffolding:** Low - Independent synthesis and analysis

**Teaching Sequence:**
1. Synthesize all previous concepts (Exposition, Rising Action, Structure, Voice)
2. Introduce macro concept: Resolution
3. Analyze how all devices work together to create resolution
4. Demonstrate understanding of complete narrative arc
5. Create independent comprehensive analysis TVODE

**Devices (3):**
- **Dramatic Irony**: 
- **Repetition**: 
- **Juxtaposition**:
