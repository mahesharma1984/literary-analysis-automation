# TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD INTEGRATED MACRO-MICRO PROGRESSION
## 5-Week Literary Analysis Curriculum

**Text:** To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee  
**Version:** 5.0 (Macro-Micro Integration)  
**Date:** November 18, 2025  
**Structure:** Macro alignment elements taught through executing micro devices

---

## CURRICULUM OVERVIEW

### Pedagogical Approach

This curriculum teaches **macro alignment elements** (Exposition, Literary Devices, Structure, Narrative Voice, Rhetorical Voice) through the **micro devices** that execute them, rather than teaching devices in isolation.

**Core Principle:** Literary concepts are not abstract ideas—they manifest through specific devices working together. Students learn to see how macro elements OPERATE through micro techniques.

### 5-Week Progression

| Week | Macro Focus | Teaching Approach | Devices | Scaffolding |
|------|-------------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Exposition | Here are devices. Let's identify them. | Direct Characterization, Indirect Characterization | High - Teacher models everything |
| 2 | Literary Devices | Literary devices create meaning through figurative language. | Metaphor, Simile, Personification, +7 more | Medium-High - Co-construction with students |
| 3 | Structure | Structure UNFOLDS through devices that create pacing. | Foreshadowing, Motif | Medium - Students lead with support |
| 4 | Narrative Voice | Narrative voice OPERATES through perspective devices. | First-Person Narration, Stream of Consciousness | Medium-Low - Independent work with feedback |
| 5 | Rhetorical Voice | Rhetorical voice CONTROLS interpretation through irony and persuasion. | Dramatic Irony, Juxtaposition, Situational Irony, +1 more | Low - Independent application |
