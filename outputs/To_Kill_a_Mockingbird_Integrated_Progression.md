# TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD INTEGRATED MACRO-MICRO PROGRESSION
## 5-Week Literary Analysis Curriculum

**Text:** To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee  
**Version:** 5.0 (Macro-Micro Integration)  
**Date:** November 21, 2025  
**Structure:** Macro alignment elements taught through executing micro devices

---

## CURRICULUM OVERVIEW

### Pedagogical Approach

This curriculum teaches **macro alignment elements** (Exposition, Literary Devices, Structure, Narrative Voice, Rhetorical Voice) through the **micro devices** that execute them, rather than teaching devices in isolation.

**Core Principle:** Literary concepts are not abstract ideas—they manifest through specific devices working together. Students learn to see how macro elements OPERATE through micro techniques.

### 5-Week Progression

| Week | Macro Focus | Teaching Approach | Devices | Scaffolding |
|------|-------------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Exposition | Here are devices. Let's identify them. | First-Person Narration, Foreshadowing, Direct Characterization, +1 more | High - Teacher models everything |
| 2 | Rising Action | Literary devices create meaning through figurative language. | Symbolism, Metaphor, Imagery | Medium-High - Co-construction with students |
| 3 | Structure | Structure UNFOLDS through devices that create pacing. | Dramatic Irony, Alliteration | Medium - Students lead with support |
| 4 | Voice | Narrative voice OPERATES through perspective devices. |  | Medium-Low - Independent work with feedback |

## WEEK 1: EXPOSITION

**Macro Concept:** How characters and setting are introduced
**Teaching Goal:** Understanding how exposition is built through devices
**Scaffolding:** High - Teacher models everything

**Teaching Sequence:**
1. Introduce concept of literary devices as author's tools
2. Define specific devices with clear examples
3. Practice identifying devices in text together
4. Explain what each device accomplishes
5. Begin simple TVODE construction

**Devices (4):**
- **First-Person Narration**: 
- **Foreshadowing**: 
- **Direct Characterization**: 
- **Personification**: 

**Macro Variables:**
- characterization_method: MIX
- mode_dominance: BAL
- mode_description:

## WEEK 3: STRUCTURE

**Macro Element:** How plot is organized and paced
**Teaching Goal:** Understanding how structure unfolds through devices
**Scaffolding:** Medium - Students lead with support

**Teaching Sequence:**
1. Review exposition and literary devices
2. Introduce macro concept: Structure

## WEEK 4: VOICE

**Macro Element:** Narrative perspective and narration
**Teaching Goal:** Understanding how voice operates through devices
**Scaffolding:** Medium-Low - Independent work with feedback

**Teaching Sequence:**
1. Synthesize previous concepts
2. Introduce macro concept: Narrative Voice
3. Analyze perspective and consciousness through devices
4. Compare voice techniques across texts
5. Create voice analysis TVODE

**Devices (0):**
