      "text": "It was almost December, and Jonas was beginning to be frightened. No. Wrong word, Jonas thought. Frightened meant that deep, sickening feeling of something terrible about to happen. Frightened was the way he had felt a year ago when an unidentified aircraft had overflown the community twice. He had seen it both times. Squinting toward the sky, he had seen the sleek jet, almost a blur at its high speed, go past, and a second later heard the blast of sound that followed. Then one more time, a moment later, from the opposite direction, the same plane. At first, he had been only fascinated. He had never seen aircraft so close, for it was against the rules for Pilots to fly over the community. Occasionally, when supplies were delivered by cargo planes to the landing field across the river, the children rode their bicycles to the riverbank and watched, intrigued, the unloading and then the takeoff directed to the west, always away from the community. But the aircraft a year ago had been different. It was not a squat, fat-bellied cargo plane but a needle-nosed single-pilot jet. Jonas, looking around anxiously, had seen others\u2014adults as well as children\u2014stop what they were doing and wait, confused, for an explanation of the frightening event.",

      "text": "Jonas watched as his father poured a fresh cup of coffee. He waited. 'You know,' his father finally said, 'every December was exciting to me when I was young. And it has been for you and Lily, too, I'm sure. Each December brings such changes.' Jonas nodded. He could remember the Decembers back to when he had become, well, probably a Four. The earlier ones were lost to him. But he observed them each year, and he remembered Lily's earliest Decembers. He remembered when his family received Lily, the day she was named, the day that she had become a One. The Ceremony for the Ones was always noisy and fun. Each December, all the newchildren born in the previous year turned One. One at a time\u2014there were always fifty in each year's group, if none had been released\u2014they had been brought to the stage by the Nurturers who had cared for them since birth. Some were already walking, wobbly on their unsteady legs; others were no more than a few days old, wrapped in blankets, held by their Nurturers. 'I enjoy the Naming,' Jonas said. His mother agreed, smiling. 'The year we got Lily, we knew, of course, that we'd receive our female, because we'd made our application and been approved. But I'd been wondering and wondering what her name would be.'",

And now you don't have it anymore! I took it from you!' But the old man laughed. 'All I gave you was one ride, on one sled, in one snow, on one hill. I have a whole world of them in my memory. I could give them to you one by one, a thousand times, and there would still be more.' 'Are you saying that I\u2014I mean we\u2014could do it again?' Jonas asked. 'I'd really like to. I think I could steer, by pulling the rope. I didn't try this time, because it was so new.' The old man, laughing, shook his head. 'Maybe another day, for a treat. But there's no time, really, just to play. I only wanted to begin by showing you how it works.' 'Now,' he said, turning businesslike, 'lie back down. I want to\u2014' Jonas did. He was eager for whatever experience would come next. But he had, suddenly, so many questions. 'Why don't we have snow, and sleds, and hills?' he asked. 'And when did we, in the past? Did my parents have sleds when they were young? Did you?' The old man shrugged and gave a short laugh. 'No,' he told Jonas. 'It's a very distant memory. That's why it was so exhausting\u2014I had to tug it forward from many generations back.'",

      "text": "'I won't! I won't go home! You can't make me!' Jonas sobbed and shouted and pounded the bed with his fists. 'Sit up, Jonas,' The Giver told him firmly. Jonas obeyed him. Weeping, shuddering, he sat on the edge of the bed. He would not look at The Giver. 'You may stay here tonight. I want to talk to you. But you must be quiet now, while I notify your family unit. No one must hear you cry.' Jonas looked up wildly. 'No one heard that little twin cry, either! No one but my father!' He collapsed in sobs again. The Giver waited silently. Finally Jonas was able to quiet himself and he sat huddled, his shoulders shaking. The Giver went to the wall speaker and clicked the switch to ON. 'Yes, Receiver. How may I help you?' 'Notify the new Receiver's family unit that he will be staying with me tonight, for additional training.' 'I will take care of that, sir. Thank you for your instructions,' the voice said. 'I will take care of that, sir. I will take care of that, sir,' Jonas mimicked in a cruel, sarcastic voice. 'I will do whatever you like, sir. I will kill people, sir. Old people? Small newborn people? I'd be happy to kill them, sir. Thank you for your instructions, sir. How may I help y\u2014' He couldn't seem to stop. The Giver grasped his shoulders firmly. Jonas fell silent and stared at him. 'Listen to me, Jonas. They can't help it. They know nothing.'",

      "text": "Using his final strength, and a special knowledge that was deep inside him, Jonas found the sled that was waiting for them at the top of the hill. Numbly his hands fumbled for the rope. He settled himself on the sled and hugged Gabe close. The hill was steep but the snow was powdery and soft, and he knew that this time there would be no ice, no fall, no pain. Inside his freezing body, his heart surged with hope. They started down. Jonas felt himself losing consciousness and with his whole being willed himself to stay upright atop the sled, clutching Gabriel, keeping him safe. The runners sliced through the snow and the wind whipped at his face as they sped in a straight line through an incision that seemed to lead to the final destination, the place that he had always felt was waiting, the Elsewhere that held their future and their past. He forced his eyes open as they went downward, downward, sliding, and all at once he could see lights, and he recognized them now. He knew they were shining through the windows of rooms, that they were the red, blue, and yellow lights that twinkled from trees in places where families created and kept memories, where they celebrated love. Downward, downward, faster and faster. Suddenly he was aware with certainty and joy that below, ahead, they were waiting for him; and that they were waiting, too, for the baby. For the first time, he heard something that he knew to be music. He heard people singing. Behind him, across vast distances of space and time, from the place he had left, he thought he heard music too. But perhaps it was only an echo.",
