      "text": "It was almost December, and Jonas was beginning to be frightened. No. Wrong word, Jonas thought. Frightened meant that deep, sickening feeling of something terrible about to happen... Jonas was careful about language. Not like his friend, Asher, who talked too fast and mixed things up, scrambling words and phrases until they were barely recognizable and often very funny... He had waited a long time for this special December. Now that it was almost upon him, he wasn't frightened, but he was... eager, he decided. He was eager for it to come. And he was excited, certainly. All of the Elevens were excited about the event that would be coming so soon. But there was a little shudder of nervousness when he thought about it, about what might happen. Apprehensive, Jonas decided. That's what I am... 'Who wants to be the first tonight, for feelings?' Jonas's father asked, at the conclusion of their evening meal. It was one of the rituals, the evening telling of feelings.",

      "text": "'Jonas,' she said, looking down at him, 'I apologize to you in particular. I caused you anguish.' 'I accept your apology,' Jonas replied shakily. 'Please come to the stage now.' Earlier that day, dressing in his own dwelling, he had practiced the kind of jaunty, self-assured walk that he hoped he could make to the stage when his turn came. All of that was forgotten now. He simply willed himself to stand, to move his feet that felt weighted and clumsy, to go forward, up the steps and across the platform until he stood at her side... 'Jonas has been selected to be our next Receiver of Memory.'... The Giver looked up at him, his face in his hands. 'I'll come back tomorrow, sir,' he said quickly. Then he hesitated. 'Unless maybe there's something I can do to help.' The Giver looked up at him, his face contorted with suffering. 'Please,' he gasped, 'take some of the pain.'... Jonas felt the joy of it as soon as the memory began. Sometimes it took a while for him to get his bearings, to find his place. But this time he fit right in and felt the happiness that pervaded the memory. He was in a room filled with people, and it was warm, with firelight glowing on a hearth.",
      "rationale": "Covers Jonas's unexpected selection as Receiver of Memory, his training with The Giver, receiving memories of both joy and pain, and his growing understanding of what his community has given up."

      "text": "Jonas glanced at the clock. There was so much work to be done, always, that he and The Giver seldom simply sat and talked, the way they just had. 'I'm sorry that I wasted so much time with my questions,' Jonas said. 'I was only asking about release because my father is releasing a newchild today. A twin. He has to select one and release the other one. They do it by weight.' Jonas glanced at the clock. 'Actually, I suppose he's already finished. I think it was this morning.'... Jonas watched the video screen above the row of switches. Its blank face began to flicker with zig-zag lines; then some numbers appeared, followed by the date and time. He was astonished and delighted that this was available to him, and surprised that he had not known... His father turned and opened the cupboard. He took out a syringe and a small bottle. Very carefully he inserted the needle into the bottle and began to fill the syringe with a clear liquid... He pushed the plunger very slowly, injecting the liquid into the scalp vein until the syringe was empty... Then he was still. With an odd, shocked feeling, Jonas recognized the gestures and posture and expression. They were familiar. He had seen them before. But he couldn't remember where... He killed it! My father killed it! Jonas said to himself, stunned at what he was realizing.",
      "rationale": "The turning point where Jonas discovers that 'release' means death by lethal injection, fundamentally changing his understanding of his community and his father, creating the crisis that drives his decision to escape."

All of it\u2014all the things they had thought through so meticulously\u2014fell apart. That night, Jonas was forced to flee. He left the dwelling shortly after the sky became dark and the community still. It was terribly dangerous because some of the work crews were still about, but he moved stealthily and silently, staying in the shadows, making his way past the darkened dwellings and the empty Central Plaza, toward the river... 'First thing tomorrow morning. We have to start our preparations for the Naming Ceremony, so we thought we'd get this taken care of right away. It's bye-bye to you, Gabe, in the morning,' Father had said, in his sweet, sing-song voice... Jonas reached the opposite side of the river, stopped briefly, and looked back. The community where his entire life had been lived lay behind him now, sleeping. At dawn, the orderly, disciplined life he had always known would continue again, without him. The life where nothing was ever unexpected. Or inconvenient. Or unusual. The life without color, pain, or past.",

      "text": "Jonas felt more and more certain that the destination lay ahead of him, very near now in the night that was approaching. None of his senses confirmed it. He saw nothing ahead except the endless ribbon of road unfolding in twisting narrow curves. He heard no sound ahead. Yet he felt it: felt that Elsewhere was not far away... Standing in the freezing mound that was thickening around his numb feet, Jonas opened his own tunic, held Gabriel to his bare chest, and tied the torn and dirty blanket around them both... Using his final strength, and a special knowledge that was deep inside him, Jonas found the sled that was waiting for them at the top of the hill. Numbly his hands fumbled for the rope. He settled himself on the sled and hugged Gabe close... He forced his eyes open as they went downward, downward, sliding, and all at once he could see lights, and he recognized them now. He knew they were shining through the windows of rooms, that they were the red, blue, and yellow lights that twinkled from trees in places where families created and kept memories, where they celebrated love. Downward, downward, faster and faster. Suddenly he was aware with certainty and joy that below, ahead, they were waiting for him; and that they were waiting, too, for the baby. For the first time, he heard something that he knew to be music. He heard people singing. Behind him, across vast distances of space and time, from the place he had left, he thought he heard music too. But perhaps it was only an echo.",
      "rationale": "Concludes with Jonas and Gabriel's arrival at Elsewhere, where they find warmth, light, music, and love\u2014everything their community had eliminated\u2014while suggesting that their escape has released the memories back to the community."
