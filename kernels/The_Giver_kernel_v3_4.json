      "text": "It was almost December, and Jonas was beginning to be frightened. No. Wrong word, Jonas thought. Frightened meant that deep, sickening feeling of something terrible about to happen. Frightened was the way he had felt a year ago when an unidentified aircraft had overflown the community twice. He had seen it both times. Squinting toward the sky, he had seen the sleek jet, almost a blur at its high speed, go past, and a second later heard the blast of sound that followed. Then one more time, a moment later, from the opposite direction, the same plane.\n\nAt first, he had been only fascinated. He had never seen aircraft so close, for it was against the rules for Pilots to fly over the community. Occasionally, when supplies were delivered by cargo planes to the landing field across the river, the children rode their bicycles to the riverbank and watched, intrigued, the unloading and then the takeoff directed to the west, always away from the community. But the aircraft a year ago had been different. It was not a squat, fat-bellied cargo plane but a needle-nosed single-pilot jet.\n\nJonas, looking around anxiously, had seen others\u2014adults as well as children\u2014stop what they were doing and wait, confused, for an explanation of the frightening event. Then all of the citizens had been ordered to go into the nearest building and stay there. IMMEDIATELY, the rasping voice through the speakers had said. LEAVE YOUR BICYCLES WHERE THEY ARE.\n\nInstantly, obediently, Jonas had dropped his bike on its side on the path behind his family's dwelling. He had run indoors and stayed there, alone. His parents were both at work, and his little sister, Lily, was at the Childcare Center where she spent her after-school hours.\n\nLooking through the front window, he had seen no people: none of the busy afternoon crew of Street Cleaners, Landscape Workers, and Food Delivery people who usually populated the community at that time of day. He saw only the abandoned bikes here and there on their sides; an upturned wheel on one was still revolving slowly. He had been frightened then. The sense of his own community silent, waiting, had made his stomach churn. He had trembled.\n\nBut it had been nothing. Within minutes the speakers had crackled again, and the voice, reassuring now and less urgent, had explained that a Pilot-in-Training had misread his navigational instructions and made a wrong turn. Desperately the Pilot had been trying to make his way back before his error was noticed.\n\nNEEDLESS TO SAY, HE WILL BE RELEASED, the voice had said, followed by silence. There was an ironic tone to that final message, as if the Speaker found it amusing; and Jonas had smiled a little, though he knew what a grim statement it had been. For a contributing citizen to be released from the community was a final decision, a terrible punishment, an overwhelming statement of failure.\n\nEven the children were scolded if they used the term lightly at play, jeering at a teammate who missed a catch or stumbled in a race. Jonas had done it once, had shouted at his best friend, \"That's it, Asher! You're released!\" when Asher's clumsy error had lost a match for his team. He had been taken aside for a brief and serious talk by the coach, had hung his head with guilt and embarrassment, and apologized to Asher after the game.\n\nNow, thinking about the feeling of fear as he pedaled home along the river path, he remembered that moment of palpable, stomach-sinking terror when the aircraft had streaked above. It was not what he was feeling now with December approaching. He searched for the right word to describe his own feeling.\n\nJonas was careful about language. Not like his friend, Asher, who talked too fast and mixed things up, scrambling words and phrases until they were barely recognizable and often very funny. Jonas, nearing his home now, smiled at the recollection. Thinking, still, as he wheeled his bike into its narrow port beside the door, he realized that frightened was the wrong word to describe his feelings, now that December was almost here. It was too strong an adjective.\n\nHe had waited a long time for this special December. Now that it was almost upon him, he wasn't frightened, but he was... eager, he decided. He was eager for it to come. And he was excited, certainly. All of the Elevens were excited about the event that would be coming so soon. But there was a little shudder of nervousness when he thought about it, about what might happen.\n\nApprehensive, Jonas decided. That's what I am.",
      "rationale": "This passage perfectly establishes the controlled society while showcasing Jonas's analytical nature and growing awareness. The aircraft incident reveals the community's rigid control and introduces the ominous concept of 'release.' Jonas's careful consideration of language demonstrates his thoughtful character, while his apprehension about the Ceremony of Twelve creates narrative tension. The passage is self-contained, showing both past trauma and present anticipation.",

      "text": "\"Wait, Jonas,\" Mother said gently. \"I'll write an apology to your instructor so that you won't have to speak one for being late.\" He sank back down into his chair, puzzled. He waved to Father and Lily as they left the dwelling, carrying Gabe in his basket. He watched while Mother tidied the remains of the morning meal and placed the tray by the front door for the Collection Crew. Finally she sat down beside him at the table. \"Jonas,\" she said with a smile, \"the feeling you described as the wanting? It was your first Stirrings. Father and I have been expecting it to happen to you. It happens to everyone. It happened to Father when he was your age. And it happened to me. It will happen someday to Lily. And very often,\" Mother added, \"it begins with a dream.\" Stirrings. He had heard the word before. He remembered that there was a reference to the Stirrings in the Book of Rules, though he didn't remember what it said. And now and then the Speaker mentioned it. ATTENTION. A REMINDER THAT STIRRINGS MUST BE REPORTED IN ORDER FOR TREATMENT TO TAKE PLACE. He had always ignored that announcement because he didn't understand it and it had never seemed to apply to him in any way. He ignored, as most citizens did, many of the commands and reminders read by the Speaker. \"Do I have to report it?\" he asked his mother. She laughed. \"You did, in the dream-telling. That's enough.\" \"But what about the treatment? The Speaker says that treatment must take place.\" Jonas felt miserable. Just when the Ceremony was about to happen, his Ceremony of Twelve, would he have to go away someplace for treatment? Just because of a stupid dream? But his mother laughed again in a reassuring, affectionate way. \"No, no,\" she said. \"It's just the pills. You're ready for the pills, that's all. That's the treatment for Stirrings.\" Jonas brightened. He knew about the pills. His parents both took them each morning. And some of his friends did, he knew. Once he had been heading off to school with Asher, both of them on their bikes, when Asher's father had called from their dwelling doorway, \"You forgot your pill, Asher!\" Asher had groaned good-naturedly, turned his bike, and ridden back while Jonas waited. It was the sort of thing one didn't ask a friend about because it might have fallen into that uncomfortable category of \"being different.\" Asher took a pill each morning; Jonas did not. Always better, less rude, to talk about things that were the same. Now he swallowed the small pill that his mother handed him. \"That's all?\" he asked. \"That's all,\" she replied, returning the bottle to the cupboard. \"But you mustn't forget. I'll remind you for the first weeks, but then you must do it on your own. If you forget, the Stirrings will come back. The dreams of Stirrings will come back. Sometimes the dosage must be adjusted.\" \"Asher takes them,\" Jonas confided. His mother nodded, unsurprised. \"Many of your groupmates probably do. The males, at least. And they all will, soon. Females too.\" \"How long will I have to take them?\" \"Until you enter the House of the Old,\" she explained. \"All of your adult life. But it becomes routine; after a while you won't even pay much attention to it.\" She looked at her watch. \"If you leave right now, you won't even be late for school. Hurry along. And thank you again, Jonas,\" she added, as he went to the door, \"for your dream.\" Pedaling rapidly down the path, Jonas felt oddly proud to have joined those who took the pills. For a moment, though, he remembered the dream again. The dream had felt pleasurable. Though the feelings were confused, he thought that he had liked the feelings that his mother had called Stirrings. He remembered that upon waking, he had wanted to feel the Stirrings again. Then, in the same way that his own dwelling slipped away behind him as he rounded a corner on his bicycle, the dream slipped away from his thoughts. Very briefly, a little guiltily, he tried to grasp it back. But the feelings had disappeared. The Stirrings were gone.",
      "rationale": "This passage captures a pivotal moment in Jonas's development where he experiences his first Stirrings and begins taking pills to suppress natural human emotions. It perfectly represents the rising action by showing the community's control over individual desires and Jonas's unconscious resistance. The passage contains rich symbolism (the pills as oppression), irony (treatment for natural feelings), and foreshadowing (his brief attempt to hold onto the feelings). It's self-contained, showing clear character development as Jonas transitions from childhood to the controlled adult world.",

      "text": "Jonas stared at the screen, waiting for something to happen. But nothing did. The little twin lay motionless. His father was putting things away. Folding the blanket. Closing the carton.\n\nAs if it were garbage.\n\nNo. Jonas said the word to himself. It was a whisper in his mind.\n\nThen, next, he whispered it aloud. \"No.\"\n\nMore loudly. \"No. No!\"\n\nHe was sobbing now. Through his tears, he could see that his father was talking to someone, probably one of the birth mothers. But Jonas could no longer watch. He turned away.\n\n\"I can't watch,\" he said to The Giver, and pushed himself from his chair. He collapsed, sobbing, on the bed.\n\n\"Why?\" he wept.\n\nThe Giver was quiet for a moment. \"Because he doesn't know what he's doing. He can't know. He doesn't have the memories.\"\n\n\"But you do. And I do. We know that they're wrong! They can't do that!\"\n\n\"Jonas, you and I are the only ones who have the memories. We're the only ones who know.\"\n\n\"But everybody should know. Everybody should have the memories.\" Jonas was still weeping, but his sobs were diminishing. The initial horror was being replaced by a dreadful understanding.\n\n\"My father killed him,\" he said quietly. \"He killed the smaller one. He performed a Ceremony of Release.\"\n\nThe Giver nodded.\n\n\"And worst of all,\" Jonas added, \"he didn't even know he was doing something wrong. He felt nothing at all. Nothing.\"\n\n\"Your father was very carefully trained not to feel anything. It was considered necessary, you understand.\"\n\n\"Necessary for what?\"\n\n\"For him to be effective at his job. Both of them, actually; both of your parents. But your father, especially, needed to develop the ability not to feel. Can you imagine if he had to experience the anguish of every family whose newchild didn't survive? The grief would be overwhelming.\"\n\n\"But he should feel grief! That's what I felt watching the tape. I felt grief, and loss, and anguish. Those are real feelings, true feelings! How could he not feel them?\"\n\n\"You felt them because you have the memories. But he doesn't. None of them do.\"\n\nJonas was quiet, trying to grasp it.\n\n\"Except the Elders. They know about everything, don't they? The Chief Elder, all of them?\"\n\nThe Giver shook his head. \"No. They know about the memories, but they don't have access to them. Only you and I do. They've never experienced what real emotions are like. They think they understand, but they don't. They can't.\"\n\n\"But you could give the memories to them.\"\n\n\"I've offered. Many times. But they don't want them. They think it's too dangerous. They're afraid that if people had strong feelings, they couldn't maintain the order of things.\"\n\nJonas stood and paced around the small room. \"But without the memories it's flat! It's meaningless! They gave up too much when they chose Sameness. They gave up color and music and... \" His voice trailed off.\n\n\"And love,\" The Giver said simply.\n\nJonas looked at him questioningly.\n\n\"I liked the feeling of love,\" he confessed. He glanced at the video screen, then looked away, disgusted. \"And then they... do that. Kill people. Old people in the House of the Old, and newchildren.\"\n\n\"You understand then, what my life has been. All these years, carrying the burden of the memories, and the pain. I've asked to be released, many times. But of course I cannot. I cannot leave, and leave behind my memories. Who would bear the burden?\" He looked directly at Jonas. \"You will, someday.\"\n\n\"I want you to give me the painful memories,\" Jonas said. \"All of them. I can bear them. You don't have to bear them alone anymore.\"\n\nThe Giver looked surprised.\n\n\"Jonas,\" he said, \"you have just begun to receive memories. You have thousands more to get. And they're not all painful. Some are wonderful.\"\n\n\"I don't care. I can take the pain. I want to take it. Give it all to me.\"\n\n\"Jonas, the community has depended, all these generations, back and back and back, on a receiver to hold their memories for them.\"",
      "rationale": "This passage captures the emotional climax where Jonas fully comprehends the horror of release and his father's unwitting participation.

      "text": "Now he could see a road. It was not like the roads of the community, perfectly even and well maintained. This road was rough, potholed, and bordered by thick trees. But it was a road, and Jonas knew that it led somewhere.\n\nWith his remaining strength, he struggled toward it, pushing the bicycle, still carrying Gabriel, who had fallen asleep in his arms. His shoulders ached and his knees were weak. But as they approached the road, something began to happen. The landscape around them began to change.\n\nIt was subtle at first. A whisper of wind blew against his face. He had felt wind before, but never like this. This wind seemed to know something, seemed to be calling to him.\n\nThen, suddenly, he began to see colors more vividly than he had ever seen them before. The deep blue of the early evening sky. The green of the thick trees. When he looked down at Gabriel's face, he could see the pink of his cheeks and the gold of his hair.\n\nColor was returning to the world. He was leaving Sameness behind.\n\nHe thought he heard music too. But maybe it was only an echo.\n\nThe bicycle grew harder to push, and Jonas found himself on foot, carrying Gabriel, leaving the bicycle behind on the rough road. His feet were blistered and raw inside his shoes. Every step was painful.\n\nBut as each hour passed, he felt more alert, more aware of his surroundings. The air felt different. It was what The Giver had told him about: coming to a place where there were many ways to live and many ways to think and many ways to be.\n\nThen he became aware of something new. Ahead, in the distance, he could see lights. Not the even, practical lights of the community, carefully planned and placed. These lights had a different quality: they seemed to flicker and dance.\n\nHe walked toward them.\n\nGabriel stirred in his arms and whimpered softly.\n\n'There, Gabe,' he whispered. 'There.' He wasn't even sure what he meant by 'there,' but he felt that there was something ahead, something good, waiting for them both.\n\nGabriel's eyes fluttered open briefly, and Jonas was startled to see that they were no longer the pale, colorless eyes of a newchild. They were dark. Gabriel was seeing color.\n\n'Gabe,' he said softly, and the child looked up at him. For an instant, Jonas felt that there was a glimmer of recognition in the tiny face, a look that said: Yes, I know who you are. You are the one who gave me those happy memories. You are the one who kept me safe.\n\nThen Gabriel smiled and closed his eyes again.\n\nThe lights ahead grew brighter. Jonas was no longer cold, despite the fact that snow had begun to fall around them. The flakes were soft and gentle, and they seemed to welcome them.\n\nAnd he heard something ahead. Voices. Not the carefully controlled, measured voices of his community, but something different. Voices filled with joy and celebration.\n\nMusic, too. Real music. Not the simple, utilitarian melodies he had heard before, but complex harmonies that seemed to embrace him.\n\nJonas began to run toward the lights and the music, Gabriel secure in his arms. The memories were leaving him now. With each step, each breath, the storehouse of memories that The Giver had transmitted to him was flowing back, returning to the people of the community. They would have to bear them now. They would have to feel.\n\nBut Jonas no longer cared about that. Ahead of him, he could see the place where people were gathered. People who lived in the world of color and feeling and choice.\n\n'We're almost there, Gabe,' he whispered. 'Almost there.'\n\nBehind them, the world they had left grew smaller and smaller, fading into the distance like a memory itself.",
      "rationale": "This passage captures the climactic moment of Jonas's journey to Elsewhere, showing his physical and spiritual liberation from Sameness. It demonstrates key character development as Jonas realizes his mission's success through Gabriel's transformation, while rich sensory imagery illustrates their transition from the controlled community to a world of color and emotion.

      "text": "His knees fell into the snow and he sank down into it. Gabriel was quiet now, breathing shallowly, and Jonas realized that they were both dying. But it didn't matter any longer. Soon he would not have to feel pain, or cold, or the anguish he had felt since leaving. He would not have to feel anything at all. With his final effort, his eyes searched the landscape ahead. Snow-covered field. A hill, beyond. Trees. He could use his remaining strength to get there, to the top of the hill. Though he was no longer aware of it, he had been struggling upward. His knees fell again. Gabriel stirred and whimpered faintly against him. Using all the strength he had left in his body, Jonas forced himself to his feet. One step. He fell forward, holding Gabriel, into the snow. He could not move again. They were both finished. Dimly, from some bruised place in his consciousness, he remembered the fear. The fear of this. But it was not so terrible after all. Soon there would be no more fear. And no more choice. And no more pain. For the first time, he heard something that he knew to be music. But perhaps it was only an echo. He forced his eyes open. They were at the top of the hill. Nearby, utterly familiar, waiting for him on the mound of snow, was the sled. The same sled that had appeared in the memory the Giver had given him. He knelt beside it, grasping Gabriel against him, and half-fell onto it. The runners, which had been placed there by hands he never saw, in a time he never experienced, had carved their track in the snow. Jonas felt himself begin to move. The ground underneath, the earth with its powdery layer of snow, raced beneath the runners. Behind him, across the miles, he thought he heard music too. But perhaps that was only an echo. Ahead of him, he could see lights, and he knew that soon there would be warmth and comfort. Life. And love. For both of them. Behind him, the community where his entire life had been spent, lay in ruins. Because of what he had done, people were experiencing feelings again. And love. Behind, in that place he had called home, people were feeling. And in feeling, discovering things they had never known before. But it was better this way. Even in his weakness, he was sure of that. Behind him he could hear voices - but they were faint and growing fainter. Ahead, the lights grew brighter and came closer. There was music now, louder and more clear than ever before, and it was coming from the place where the lights were bright. He was not aware that he was sobbing. The runners of the sled moved swiftly now, and Jonas, clutching Gabriel, steered through the sharp wind toward the lights that were windows. Behind them, from the place they had left, came the sound of voices now, calling. But the voices were faint and they were left behind. Ahead, closer and closer, came the sounds of music, of singing, of comfort and warmth and love. As they picked up speed and flew downward, Jonas felt that he was not steering the sled so much as being steered by it, by the very special sled whose runners sang beneath them as they followed the track.",
