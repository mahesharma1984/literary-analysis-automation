      "text": "When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn't have cared less, so long as he could pass and punt. When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out. We lived on the main residential street in town\u2014Atticus, Jem and I, plus Calpurnia our cook. Jem and I found our father satisfactory: he played with us, read to us, and treated us with courteous detachment. That was the summer Dill came to us.",

      "text": "The remainder of my schooldays were no more auspicious than the first. Indeed, they were an endless Project that slowly evolved into a Unit, in which miles of construction paper and wax crayon were expended by the State of Alabama in its well-meaning but fruitless efforts to teach me Group Dynamics. As the year passed, released from school thirty minutes before Jem, who had to stay until three o'clock, I ran by the Radley Place as fast as I could, not stopping until I reached the safety of our front porch. One afternoon as I raced by, something caught my eye and caught it in such a way that I took a deep breath, a long look around, and went back. Two live oaks stood at the edge of the Radley lot; their roots reached out into the side-road and made it bumpy. Something about one of the trees attracted my attention. Some tinfoil was sticking in a knot-hole just above my eye level, winking at me in the afternoon sun. I stood on tiptoe, hastily looked around once more, reached into the hole, and withdrew two pieces of chewing gum minus their outer wrappers.",

      "text": "In ones and twos, men got out of the cars. Shadows became substance as light revealed solid shapes moving toward the jail door. Atticus remained where he was. The men hid him from view. 'He in there, Mr. Finch?' a man said. 'He is,' we heard Atticus answer, 'and he's asleep. Don't wake him up.' In obedience to my father, there followed what I later realized was a sickeningly comic aspect of an unfunny situation: the men talked in near-whispers. 'You know what we want,' another man said. 'Get aside from the door, Mr. Finch.' 'You can turn around and go home again, Walter,' Atticus said pleasantly. This was too good to miss. I broke away from Jem and ran as fast as I could to Atticus. 'H-ey, Atticus!' I thought he would have a fine surprise, but his face killed my joy. A flash of plain fear was going out of his eyes, but returned when Dill and Jem wriggled into the light. 'Hey, Mr. Cunningham.' The man did not hear me, it seemed. 'Hey, Mr. Cunningham. How's your entailment gettin' along?' Mr. Walter Cunningham's legal affairs were well known to me; Atticus had once described them at length.",

It has relied instead upon the testimony of two witnesses whose evidence has not only been called into serious question on cross-examination, but has been flatly contradicted by the defendant. The defendant is not guilty, but somebody in this courtroom is. I have nothing but pity in my heart for the chief witness for the state, but my pity does not extend so far as to her putting a man's life at stake, which she has done in an effort to get rid of her own guilt. I say guilt, gentlemen, because it was guilt that motivated her. She has committed no crime, she has merely broken a rigid and time-honored code of our society, a code so severe that whoever breaks it is hounded from our midst as unfit to live with. She is the victim of cruel poverty and ignorance, but I cannot pity her: she is white. She knew full well the enormity of her offense, but because her desires were stronger than the code she was breaking, she persisted in breaking it.",

'I can tell we're under the big oak because we're passin' through a cool spot. Careful now, and don't fall again.' Someone leaped at us. 'God amighty!' Jem yelled. 'Run, Scout! Run! Run!' Jem screamed. I took one giant step and found myself reeling: my arms useless, in the dark, I could not keep my balance. 'Jem, Jem, help me, Jem!' Something crushed the chicken wire around me. From somewhere near by came scuffling, kicking sounds, sounds of shoes and flesh scraping dirt and roots. Someone rolled against me and I felt Jem. More scuffling, and there came a dull crunching sound and Jem screamed. Suddenly he was jerked backwards and flung on the ground, almost carrying me with him. The man was walking heavily and unsteadily toward the road. He was carrying Jem. By the time I reached the corner the man was crossing our front yard. Light from our front door framed Atticus for an instant; he ran down the steps, and together, he and the man took Jem inside.",
