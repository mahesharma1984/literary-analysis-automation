## SECTION 2: DEVICE ANALYSIS (Building TVODE Components)

**Note to Students:** The answers you create in this section will become parts of your analytical sentence in the TVODE worksheet.

---

### DEVICE 1: {{DEVICE_1_NAME}}

#### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**{{DEVICE_1_NAME}} is:**

{{DEVICE_1_DEFINITION}}

**Example from model:** {{DEVICE_1_MODEL_EXAMPLE}}

---

#### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Your Turn:** Find an example of **{{DEVICE_1_NAME}}** in *{{TEXT_TITLE}}*.

**Where to look:**
{{DEVICE_1_EXAMPLE_LOCATIONS}}

**My Example:**

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **TOPIC** - the device you will analyze.

---

**Teacher Checkpoint:** Did students complete matching BEFORE moving to multiple choice? ☐ Yes ☐ No  
*(If No, STOP. Process breakdown - return to matching.)*

---

#### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**What does {{DEVICE_1_NAME}} DO in this text? What is its purpose or function?**

**A)** {{DEVICE_1_OPTION_A}}  
**B)** {{DEVICE_1_OPTION_B}}  
**C)** {{DEVICE_1_OPTION_C}}  
**D)** {{DEVICE_1_OPTION_D}}

**Your Answer:** ______

**TVODE Note:** This is your **OBJECT** - what the device does or shows in the text.

**Design Note:** Answers describe function/purpose (WHAT the device does), not effect (WHY). Two options should be "quite possible." All answers should be the same length, a single clause; don't use complex sentences for answers. Make sure you randomize multiple choice answers across questions for device 1, 2, 3, etc.

---

#### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Put these details in order to show HOW {{DEVICE_1_NAME}} is used in the text.**

**A)** {{DEVICE_1_SEQUENCE_A}}  
**B)** {{DEVICE_1_SEQUENCE_B}}  
**C)** {{DEVICE_1_SEQUENCE_C}}

**Your Answer:** 1-___ , 2-___ , 3-___

**Teacher Note:** Answers should be RANDOMIZED (not 1-2-3 order). Correct answer format: "1-B, 2-A, 3-C"

---

#### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Now that you understand HOW the device works, write the specific detail from the text that best shows this.**

Use this format: "shown through [specific detail/example from text]"

Your Detail:

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **DETAIL** - the specific textual evidence that supports your analysis.

**Teacher Note:** Students should write a phrase/short sentence based on their sequencing understanding. This becomes the Detail component of TVODE.
