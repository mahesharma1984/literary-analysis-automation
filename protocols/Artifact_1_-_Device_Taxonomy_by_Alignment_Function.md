Purpose
This taxonomy reclassifies literary devices by their functional role in creating alignment between narrative and rhetorical layers, rather than by descriptive type. Each device is classified across three dimensions to enable computational modeling of how texts produce meaning.
Source: Computational Model of Meaning Production LEM (v1.0)

Classification Framework
Three Classification Dimensions
Dimension 1: Operational Layer
Where does the device primarily operate?
* Narrative-Only (N): Operates primarily on story structure, sequencing, or perspective
* Rhetorical-Only (R): Operates primarily on persuasion, tone, or interpretation guidance
* Bridge (B): Operates simultaneously on both narrative and rhetorical layers
Dimension 2: Alignment Function
How does the device affect the narrative-rhetoric relationship?
* Reinforcing (Re): Strengthens correspondence between narrative and rhetoric; creates coherence
* Tensioning (Te): Creates productive contradiction or distance between layers; generates complexity
* Mediating (Me): Translates or bridges between narrative events and rhetorical meaning; enables interpretation
Dimension 3: Reader Engagement
How conscious is the reader of the device's operation?
* Transparent (T): Reader processes unconsciously; device invisible
* Visible (V): Reader aware of device but focuses on effect
* Foregrounded (F): Device becomes object of attention; self-conscious technique

Engagement	Count	Percentage
Transparent (T)	12	24%
Visible (V)	28	56%
Foregrounded (F)	10	20%
Key Insight: Most devices are visible to aware readers, but substantial minority operate unconsciously or demand attention.

USAGE GUIDELINES
For Text Tagging
1. Identify all devices present in text
2. Note frequency and position of each
3. Tag using three-letter code (e.g., B|Te|V)
4. Document clustering patterns (which devices appear together)
For Alignment Analysis
1. Separate devices by operational layer
2. Identify dominant alignment function (reinforcing vs. tensioning)
3. Assess reader engagement level (how conscious is technique)
4. Determine if device use matches rhetorical intent
For Pedagogical Application
1. Transparent devices: Teach recognition first
2. Visible devices: Teach both recognition and production
3. Foregrounded devices: Teach only to advanced students
4. Progress from reinforcing → mediating → tensioning
For Quality Evaluation
* High quality: Devices match rhetorical intent, appropriate to genre
* Medium quality: Devices present but underutilized or inconsistent
* Low quality: Device use contradicts rhetoric or draws unwanted attention

NAMING CONVENTIONS
When identifying devices, use the BASE NAME only:

- ✓ "Motif" NOT "Hope Motif" or "Color Motif"

- ✓ "Symbolism" NOT "Light Symbolism" or "Water Symbolism"

- ✓ "Imagery" NOT "Visual Imagery" or "Auditory Imagery"

For Irony, ALWAYS specify type:

- ✓ "Verbal Irony" or "Situational Irony" or "Dramatic Irony" or "Structural Irony"

- ✗ "Irony" (too vague)

Device names should match taxonomy exactly. Do not create compound names or qualified versions.

SPECIAL DEVICE COMBINATIONS
