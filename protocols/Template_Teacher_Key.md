## ASSESSMENT RUBRIC

### TVODE Sentence Construction (Per Device)

| Criterion | Emerging (1-2) | Developing (3-4) | Proficient (5-6) | Advanced (7-8) |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Topic** | Device not identified or incorrect | Device identified but unclear | Device clearly identified | Device clearly identified with sophisticated framing |
| **Verb** | Missing or inappropriate | Generic verb (uses) | Appropriate action verb | Precise, varied verb choices |
| **Object** | Unclear or missing | Function stated but incomplete | Function clearly stated | Function clearly stated with nuance |
| **Detail** | Missing or vague | Present but generic | Specific textual reference | Specific, integrated textual evidence |
| **Effect** | Missing | Stated but unclear | Clear impact on meaning | Sophisticated analysis of impact |

**Target Scores:**
- **EAL Tier:** 15-20 points (Developing-Proficient)
- **Standard Tier:** 20-30 points (Proficient)
- **High Tier:** 30-40 points (Proficient-Advanced)

## COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS TO ADDRESS

### Literary Analysis Phase

**Misconception 1:** "The device IS the theme"
- **Correction:** Devices are tools the author uses; they're not the same as themes. The device helps reveal or develop the theme.

**Misconception 2:** "Any example from the text counts"
- **Correction:** The example must specifically show the device in action, not just mention related content.

**Misconception 3:** "Effect and Object are the same thing"
- **Correction:** Object = what the device does. Effect = the impact on meaning/reader.

### TVODE Construction Phase

**Misconception 1:** "TVODE should be 5 separate sentences"
- **Correction:** TVODE is ONE integrated sentence with all components connected.

**Misconception 2:** "Detail means any quote from the text"
- **Correction:** Detail should be specific evidence showing HOW the device works.

**Misconception 3:** "I can write TVODE in any order"
- **Correction:** The order matters: T→V→O→D→E creates logical flow.

## DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGIES

### For Struggling Students (EAL)
- Pre-teach device definitions before worksheet
- Provide sentence frames for all activities
- Allow pair work for Step 6 (Effect categorization)
- Focus on 1 device only, master it completely

### For Advanced Students (High Tier)
- Add 3rd device for additional challenge
- Require integration of multiple text examples
- Ask for comparison of device usage across different sections
- Challenge them to identify additional devices not on worksheet

### For Students with Identified Needs
- Provide pre-filled model examples
- Allow oral responses recorded by teacher/aide
- Simplify Step 6 to 2 categories instead of 3
- Use highlighted text with devices pre-identified
