Purpose
This taxonomy reclassifies literary devices by their functional role in creating alignment between narrative and rhetorical layers, rather than by descriptive type. Each device is classified across three dimensions to enable computational modeling of how texts produce meaning.
Source: Computational Model of Meaning Production LEM (v1.0)

Classification Framework
Three Classification Dimensions
Dimension 1: Operational Layer
Where does the device primarily operate?
* Narrative-Only (N): Operates primarily on story structure, sequencing, or perspective
* Rhetorical-Only (R): Operates primarily on persuasion, tone, or interpretation guidance
* Bridge (B): Operates simultaneously on both narrative and rhetorical layers
Dimension 2: Alignment Function
How does the device affect the narrative-rhetoric relationship?
* Reinforcing (Re): Strengthens correspondence between narrative and rhetoric; creates coherence
* Tensioning (Te): Creates productive contradiction or distance between layers; generates complexity
* Mediating (Me): Translates or bridges between narrative events and rhetorical meaning; enables interpretation
Dimension 3: Reader Engagement
How conscious is the reader of the device's operation?
* Transparent (T): Reader processes unconsciously; device invisible
* Visible (V): Reader aware of device but focuses on effect
* Foregrounded (F): Device becomes object of attention; self-conscious technique

Complete Device Taxonomy
NARRATIVE STRUCTURE DEVICES
1. Linear Chronology
Classification: N | Re | T Definition: Events presented in cause-effect temporal sequence Alignment Function: Reinforces logical/causal rhetorical arguments by matching story order to argument order Reader Experience: Transparent; readers follow naturally without awareness Example: Most realist fiction; journalistic narrative Use Case: When rhetoric requires clear causation or moral progression
2. Non-Linear Chronology (Flashback/Flashforward)
Classification: N | Te/Me | V Definition: Disrupts temporal sequence through analepsis or prolepsis Alignment Function: Can create tension (disrupting rhetorical flow) or mediate (revealing hidden causes) Reader Experience: Visible; reader aware of time manipulation Example: Slaughterhouse-Five (Vonnegut) - "unstuck in time" reinforces fatalism Use Case: When rhetoric requires questioning causation or revealing determinism
3. Frame Narrative
Classification: N | Me | V Definition: Story within story; outer narrator frames inner narrative Alignment Function: Mediates by adding interpretive layer between inner story and reader Reader Experience: Visible; reader aware of dual narrative levels Example: Heart of Darkness (Conrad) - frame creates distance from colonial violence Use Case: When rhetoric requires critical distance or contextual interpretation
4. In Medias Res
Classification: N | Te | V Definition: Beginning in middle of action, filling backstory later Alignment Function: Creates tension by disrupting orientation; reader must reconstruct Reader Experience: Visible; reader notices disorientation then reconstruction Example: The Odyssey - begins with Odysseus trapped, flashbacks fill journey Use Case: When rhetoric emphasizes immediacy or consequence over cause

USAGE GUIDELINES
For Text Tagging
1. Identify all devices present in text
2. Note frequency and position of each
3. Tag using three-letter code (e.g., B|Te|V)
4. Document clustering patterns (which devices appear together)
For Alignment Analysis
1. Separate devices by operational layer
2. Identify dominant alignment function (reinforcing vs. tensioning)
3. Assess reader engagement level (how conscious is technique)
4. Determine if device use matches rhetorical intent
For Pedagogical Application
1. Transparent devices: Teach recognition first
2. Visible devices: Teach both recognition and production
3. Foregrounded devices: Teach only to advanced students
4. Progress from reinforcing → mediating → tensioning
For Quality Evaluation
* High quality: Devices match rhetorical intent, appropriate to genre
* Medium quality: Devices present but underutilized or inconsistent
* Low quality: Device use contradicts rhetoric or draws unwanted attention

SPECIAL DEVICE COMBINATIONS
