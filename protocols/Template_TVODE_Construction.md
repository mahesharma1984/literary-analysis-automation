## MODEL SENTENCE ANALYSIS (Teacher Demonstrates)

### Example Topic Sentence:
*"The author uses summary vs. scene to control pacing and deepen Harry's isolation, shown through the contrast between ten-year overviews and detailed daily moments."*

### TVODE Deconstruction (Class Practice):

| Component | Identified Text from Model | Word Count |
|-----------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Topic** | The author's use of summary vs. scene | ~7 words |
| **Verb** | uses / controls / shown through | 1-2 words |
| **Object** | to control pacing and deepen isolation | ~6 words |
| **Detail** | contrast between ten-year overviews and daily moments | ~8 words |
| **Effect** | (embedded in Object - "deepen isolation") | integrated |

**Target Word Count:** 15-20 words (Stage 2-3 LFWF)

**Teacher Checkpoint:** Can students identify 3/5 TVODE components?  
☐ Yes (≥60%) ☐ No (<60% → simplify to T+V+O only)

## ACTIVITY 1: TOPIC STATEMENT

Your topic identifies WHAT you're analyzing. Complete the topic frame:

**The author's use of** _____________________________________________

### Device 1: {{DEVICE_1_NAME}}

**Correct answer:** {{DEVICE_1_NAME}}

**Where to find this device:**
{{DEVICE_1_LOCATION_PROMPT}}

Write your complete topic statement here:

_________________________________________________________________

### Device 2: {{DEVICE_2_NAME}}

**Correct answer:** {{DEVICE_2_NAME}}

**Where to find this device:**
{{DEVICE_2_LOCATION_PROMPT}}

Write your complete topic statement here:

_________________________________________________________________

## ACTIVITY 2: MATCH OBJECTS

**Instructions:** Match each Topic+Device to the correct OBJECT (what the device does in THIS text).

**Object Bank (randomized):**
- **Object A:** {{DEVICE_1_OBJECT}}
- **Object B:** {{DEVICE_2_OBJECT}}
- **Object C:** {{DEVICE_3_OBJECT}} (High Tier Only)

| Topic + Device | Object |
|----------------|--------|
| **Device 1:** The author's use of {{DEVICE_1_NAME}} | |
| **Device 2:** The author's use of {{DEVICE_2_NAME}} | |
| **Device 3:** The author's use of {{DEVICE_3_NAME}} (High Tier) | |

**Output:** You now have T + O pairings for each device.

## ACTIVITY 3: INSERT VERB (Cloze Exercise)

**Instructions:** Choose the best VERB to connect your Topic to your Object. The verb should show how the device creates meaning.

**Verb Bank:**
- demonstrates
- reveals
- creates
- employs
- uses
- shows
- highlights
- emphasizes

**Complete these sentences:**

1. **Device 1:** The author's use of {{DEVICE_1_NAME}} _____________ {{DEVICE_1_OBJECT}}

2. **Device 2:** The author's use of {{DEVICE_2_NAME}} _____________ {{DEVICE_2_OBJECT}}

3. **Device 3 (High Tier):** The author's use of {{DEVICE_3_NAME}} _____________ {{DEVICE_3_OBJECT}}

**Output:** You now have T + V + O sentences.

### Detail Bank (specific textual references):
- **Detail A (Device 1):** {{DEVICE_1_DETAIL}}
- **Detail B (Device 2):** {{DEVICE_2_DETAIL}}
- **Detail C (Device 3 - High Tier):** {{DEVICE_3_DETAIL}}

### Effect Bank (impact on meaning/reader):
- **Effect A (Device 1):** {{DEVICE_1_EFFECT}}
- **Effect B (Device 2):** {{DEVICE_2_EFFECT}}
- **Effect C (Device 3 - High Tier):** {{DEVICE_3_EFFECT}}

### Connector Menu (to link Detail and Effect):
- , which [Effect]
- , creating [Effect]
- , shown through [Detail]
- to reveal [Effect]
- , deepening [Effect]
