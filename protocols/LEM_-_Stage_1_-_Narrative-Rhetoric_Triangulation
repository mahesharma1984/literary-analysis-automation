Version: 2.0 Status: Pure Infrastructure - No Pedagogical Application Dependencies: None (foundational layer) Date: November 2025

Purpose
This LEM establishes the computational infrastructure for classifying how texts produce meaning through the alignment relationship between narrative and rhetorical components, mediated by literary devices. All downstream applications (Stage 2: Logic Articulation, Stage 3: Pedagogical Application, Stage 4: Cross-Vertical Applications) depend on this taxonomy.

Definition: Techniques operating on both narrative and rhetorical layers to create alignment and generate meaning.

* Mediating (Me): Translates between N and R
Dimension 3: Reader Engagement
* Transparent (T): Reader processes unconsciously
* Visible (V): Reader aware but focuses on effect
* Foregrounded (F): Device becomes object of attention
1.3.2 Core Device Taxonomy (50 Devices)
[See Artifact 1: Device Taxonomy by Alignment Function for complete 50-device classification]
Examples:
* Linear Chronology: N | Re | T
* Unreliable Narrator: B | Te | V/F
* Metaphor: B | Me | T/V
* Dramatic Irony: B | Te | V
* Free Indirect Discourse: B | Me | T

2. ALIGNMENT TYPES
2.1 Reinforcing Alignment
Definition: Narrative and rhetorical layers correspond directly; devices strengthen coherence.
Pattern: N → D → R (direct reinforcement)
Characteristics:
* High correspondence between N and R variables
* Devices function transparently or visibly
* Reader experiences coherent, unified meaning
* Minimal tension between layers
Example Configuration:
* Narrative: Reliable narrator, linear chronology, clear causality
* Rhetoric: Explicit thesis, determinate interpretation
* Devices: Scene, dialogue, motif (all reinforcing)
* Meaning: Clear moral/thematic statement
2.2 Productive Misalignment (Tensioning)
Definition: Narrative and rhetorical layers deliberately contradict; devices create interpretive complexity.
Pattern: N ≠ R, mediated by D (tension = meaning)
Characteristics:
* Low correspondence between N and R variables
* Devices create visible or foregrounded techniques
* Reader experiences productive ambiguity
* Gap between layers IS the meaning
Example Configuration:
* Narrative: Unreliable narrator, fragmented chronology
* Rhetoric: Implicit themes, indeterminate interpretation
* Devices: Dramatic irony, situational irony (tensioning)
* Meaning: Critique of subjectivity/memory/truth
2.3 Failed Alignment
Definition: Narrative and rhetorical layers contradict unintentionally; devices fail to mediate.
Pattern: N ⊥ R, D ineffective (confusion, not complexity)
Characteristics:
* Contradictions feel accidental, not deliberate
* Devices deployed inconsistently or inappropriately
* Reader experiences confusion, not productive ambiguity
* Meaning unclear or incoherent
Example Configuration:
* Narrative: Inconsistent POV, unmotivated plot shifts
* Rhetoric: Unclear argument, contradictory themes
* Devices: Mismatched tone, inappropriate register
* Meaning: Text fails to produce coherent interpretation

3. COMPUTATIONAL ARCHITECTURE
3.1 Text as Configuration
Any text = configuration in multi-dimensional space defined by:
* 10 Narrative Voice variables
* 10 Narrative Structure variables
* 8 Rhetorical Voice variables
* 6 Rhetorical Structure variables
* 50+ Device presence/frequency values
* Total: 84+ discrete, taggable variables
3.2 Alignment Measurement
Meaning = f(N_v, N_s, R_v, R_s, D, A)
Where:
* N_v = Narrative voice configuration
* N_s = Narrative structure configuration
* R_v = Rhetorical voice configuration
* R_s = Rhetorical structure configuration
* D = Device set and deployment pattern
* A = Alignment type (reinforcing/tensioning/failed)
Computational Operations:
1. Similarity measures: N ↔ R correspondence
2. Tension indices: N ≠ R contradiction patterns
3. Device mediation effectiveness: How D bridges N-R gap
4. Alignment type classification: Re/Te/Failed
5. Mechanism identification: Which meaning production pattern

6.2 Known Limitations
1. Medium Specificity: Taxonomy optimized for prose narrative; requires adaptation for drama, poetry, film
2. Cultural Bias: Variables reflect Western literary tradition; may require expansion for non-Western texts
3. Historical Variation: Some variables more relevant to modern texts; historical texts may require additional categories
4. Boundary Cases: Some texts resist classification; protocol must include "ambiguous" or "hybrid" options

7. VERSION CONTROL

Next Steps:
1. Expand device taxonomy beyond core 50
2. Add medium-specific variables (film, drama, poetry)
3. Develop historical variation framework
4. Conduct large-scale validation study (500+ texts)
