Purpose
A systematic procedure for classifying any narrative text across all dimensions of the Computational Model of Meaning Production. This protocol enables consistent tagging by multiple raters to build a corpus of classified texts for analysis, pedagogy, and algorithm training.
Source: Computational Model LEM (v1.0) + Device Taxonomy (v1.0)

Protocol Overview
Tagging Process (5 Stages)
Stage 1: Narrative Voice Classification (10 variables) Stage 2: Narrative Structure Classification (10 variables) Stage 3: Rhetorical Voice Classification (8 variables) Stage 4: Rhetorical Structure Classification (6 variables) Stage 5: Device Identification and Classification (50+ devices)
Total Output: ~84+ tagged variables per text

STAGE 1: NARRATIVE VOICE CLASSIFICATION
Variable 1.1: Point of View (POV)
Question: Who is telling the story?
Options:
* FP = First Person ("I" narrator who is a character)
* SP = Second Person ("You" as protagonist - rare)
* TPL = Third Person Limited (access to one character's thoughts)
* TPO = Third Person Omniscient (access to all characters' thoughts)
Decision Rules:
* If narrator uses "I" and is in the story → FP
* If narrator addresses reader as "you" as protagonist → SP
* If narrator uses "he/she" and enters ONE mind → TPL
* If narrator uses "he/she" and enters MULTIPLE minds → TPO
Example Tags:
* The Catcher in the Rye: FP
* Harry Potter: TPL
* Middlemarch: TPO

Variable 1.2: Focalization
Question: Whose perspective filters the information?
Options:
* INT = Internal (limited to character's perception)
* EXT = External (narrator observes but doesn't enter minds)
* ZERO = Zero focalization (omniscient, no limitation)
Decision Rules:
* If we only know what one character perceives/thinks → INT
* If we see actions but not thoughts → EXT
* If we have unlimited access to all information → ZERO
Combination Rules:
* FP is always INT (first person = internal by definition)
* TPL is usually INT (limited = internal to one character)
* TPO is usually ZERO (omniscient = no limitation)
* SP can be any (depends on access to "your" thoughts)
Example Tags:
* The Great Gatsby: INT (filtered through Nick)
* Hills Like White Elephants (Hemingway): EXT (only dialogue/action)
* Anna Karenina: ZERO (enters all minds)

Variable 1.3: Narrator Reliability
Question: Should we trust the narrator's account?
Options:
* REL = Reliable (consistent with story world facts/morals)
* UNREL = Unreliable (biased, deceptive, naive, mentally unstable)
Decision Rules:
* If narrator's claims match story events and authorial intent → REL
* If narrator contradicts themselves, is proven wrong, or is clearly biased → UNREL
* If ambiguous, ask: Does the text INVITE us to question the narrator?
Warning Signs of Unreliability:
* Internal contradictions in narrator's account
* Other characters' accounts contradict narrator
* Narrator's actions contradict their claims
* Narrator is drunk, mentally ill, very young, or heavily biased
* Text creates ironic distance between narrator and reader
Example Tags:
* Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird: REL (reliable child perspective)
* Nick in The Great Gatsby: UNREL (biased toward Gatsby)
* Narrator in Fight Club: UNREL (mentally unstable)

Variable 1.4: Temporal Distance
Question: When is the narrator telling the story relative to events?
Options:
* IMM = Immediate (close to events, present tense or immediate past)
* RETRO = Retrospective (distant, looking back with reflection)
Decision Rules:
* Present tense or very recent past → IMM
* Distant past with reflection/hindsight markers → RETRO
* Look for phrases like "Now I understand..." or "Years later..." → RETRO
Example Tags:
* The Catcher in the Rye: IMM (Holden telling as it unfolds)
* Great Expectations: RETRO (Pip reflecting on youth)

Variable 1.5: Narrative Mode Dominance
Question: Does the text mostly show or tell?
Options:
* MIM = Mimetic dominant (showing: dialogue, scene, dramatization)
* DIE = Diegetic dominant (telling: summary, exposition, narration)
* BAL = Balanced (roughly equal showing and telling)
Decision Rules:
* Count pages/paragraphs of dialogue vs. narration
* If >60% dialogue/scene → MIM
* If >60% summary/exposition → DIE
* If 40-60% → BAL
Example Tags:
* Hemingway stories: MIM (heavy dialogue, minimal narration)
* Middlemarch: DIE (narrator commentary dominant)
* Most contemporary fiction: BAL

Variable 1.6: Free Indirect Discourse
Question: Does third-person narration blend with character voice?
Options:
* YES = Present (narration slides into character's idiom/perspective)
* NO = Absent (clear separation between narrator and character)
* N/A = Not applicable (first-person or already inside character's head)
Decision Rules:
* Only applies to third-person narration
* Look for: Character's vocabulary/syntax appearing in narrator's voice
* Look for: Narrator echoing character's perceptions without quote marks
Example Tags:
* Emma (Austen): YES (narrator echoes Emma's thoughts)
* The Old Man and the Sea: NO (clear narrator-character separation)
* The Catcher in the Rye: N/A (first-person)

Variable 1.7: Stream of Consciousness
Question: Is there unfiltered thought flow?
Options:
* YES = Present (extended passages of raw thought)
* NO = Absent
* PARTIAL = Occasional brief moments only
Decision Rules:

Variable 1.8: Character Revelation Method
Question: How do we learn about characters?
Options:
* EXP = Expository (narrator tells us traits directly)

* RETRO = Retroactive (meaning changes through later revelations)
* MIX = Mixed (combination of methods)
Decision Rules:
* EXP: "John was cruel" or direct character description
* DRAM: No direct telling; we infer from what characters do/say
* RETRO: Flashbacks or revelations change our understanding
* MIX: Most texts use combination
Example Tags:
* Dickens: EXP (direct character description)
* Hemingway: DRAM (inference from behavior)

ALIGNMENT ASSESSMENT (qualitative)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

Quality Assessment: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]
Notes: [Free-form observations about how components interact]

INTER-RATER RELIABILITY PROTOCOL
Training Requirements
1. Study all definitions and decision rules
2. Practice on 10 training texts with answer keys
3. Achieve >90% agreement on training set before independent tagging
Tagging Procedure
1. Read complete text before tagging
2. Complete Stages 1-4 first (voice/structure)
3. Then identify devices (Stage 5)
4. Review for internal consistency
5. Have second rater independently tag same text
6. Compare results and resolve discrepancies
Agreement Calculation
* Total variables tagged: ~84
* Agreement score = (# agreements / 84) × 100
* Target: >85% agreement
* If <85%: Discuss discrepancies, refine definitions, retag
Discrepancy Resolution
* If disagree: Consult definitions and decision rules
* If still disagree: Third rater breaks tie
* Document reasoning for final decision
* Update decision rules if pattern emerges

QUALITY CONTROL
Internal Consistency Checks
Check 1: POV-Focalization Alignment
* FP must be INT
* TPO usually ZERO
* Flag mismatches for review
Check 2: Reliability-Device Alignment
* UNREL narrators should have IRONY devices
* Check if coding matches
Check 3: Structure-Pacing Alignment
* SCENE dominant should have high SCENE:SUMMARY ratio
* Verify consistency
Check 4: Tone-Device Alignment
* IRONIC tone should have irony devices
* SOLEMN tone unlikely to have comic devices
* Check for contradictions
Check 5: Metafiction-Voice Alignment
* HIGH metafiction should have FOURTH-WALL-BREAK or METAFICTION devices
* Verify presence

USAGE NOTES
Time Requirements
* Short story (5-10 pages): 1-2 hours
* Novella (50-100 pages): 3-5 hours
* Novel (300+ pages): 6-10 hours
Difficulty Calibration
* Easy: Realist fiction with stable conventions
* Medium: Modernist fiction with some complexity
* Hard: Postmodern/experimental fiction with unstable features
Special Cases
Epistolary Novels:
* Tag each letter-writer separately or use MULTIPLE voice
Multiple Narrators:
* Create separate profiles for each narrator OR
* Tag dominant narrator and note SHIFT/MULTIPLE
Poetry:
* Adapt as needed; many variables N/A
* Focus on devices and rhetorical elements
Drama:
* Minimal narrative voice (mostly dialogue)
* Focus on dramatic irony, structure, devices in dialogue

VERSION CONTROL
Version: 1.0 Date: 2025 Status: Operational framework complete Tested: Pending empirical validation Next Steps:
1. Create training materials with worked examples
2. Conduct inter-rater reliability study
3. Refine decision rules based on discrepancies
4. Build digital tagging interface
