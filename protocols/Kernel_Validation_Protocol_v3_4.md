# KERNEL VALIDATION PROTOCOL - CONDENSED

## Stage 1: Freytag Section Identification

Identify the five Freytag dramatic structure sections and map them to chapter ranges:

1. **Exposition** - Character/setting establishment
2. **Rising Action** - Conflict development  
3. **Climax** - Turning point/peak tension
4. **Falling Action** - Consequences unfold
5. **Resolution** - Final outcome/closure

**Requirements:**
- Chapter ranges must be sequential (no gaps)
- Chapter ranges must cover entire book (1 to N)
- Specify primary chapter for each section (most representative)
- Provide 2-3 sentence rationale for each section

## Stage 2A: Macro Alignment Tagging

Tag all 84 macro alignment variables across narrative and rhetorical dimensions.

**Output Structure:**
- Narrative Voice (11 variables)
- Narrative Structure (10 variables)
- Rhetorical Voice (8 variables)
- Rhetorical Structure (6 variables)
- Device Mediation summary

Use code tags from Artifact 2 (e.g., TPL, INT, REL).

Provide brief descriptions explaining each code selection.

## Stage 2B: Micro Device Identification

Identify 15-25 literary devices across the text, assigned to Freytag sections.

**For each device provide:**

- Device name (from Artifact 1 taxonomy)

- Classification code: [Layer]|[Function]|[Engagement]

  - Layer: N (Narrative), R (Rhetorical), B (Both)

  - Function: Re (Representational), Te (Textural), Me (Mediation)

  - Engagement: T (Thought), F (Feeling), V (Vivid sensory)

- Assigned Freytag section

- Text example with page/chapter reference

- Alignment function explanation

**Distribution target:**

- Exposition: 3-5 devices

- Rising Action: 4-6 devices

- Climax: 3-5 devices

- Falling Action: 3-5 devices

- Resolution: 2-4 devices

**Requirements:**

- Devices must come from Artifact 1 taxonomy

- Each device appears once (most prominent usage)

- Examples must be actual quotes from text

- Classification must match taxonomy definition

## Stage 3: Reasoning Document Generation

### Purpose

Generate a reasoning document that derives an **alignment pattern** from the synthesis of narrative and rhetorical codes, then explains how micro devices execute that pattern.

### 3.1 Alignment Pattern Derivation

The pattern emerges from code intersection—not invented separately:

```
NARRATIVE CODES              RHETORICAL CODES           ALIGNMENT PATTERN
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
POV + Focalization  ───┐                      
                       ├──► WHO controls    ───┐
Intrusion + Temporal ──┘    information?       │
                                               ├──► [Pattern Name]
Stance + Tone ─────────┐                       │    
                       ├──► WHAT is the    ───┘
Irony + Mediation ─────┘    rhetorical intent?
```

**Examples**:

- TPL + INT + RETRO + OBJ + SIT → "Stoic Retrospection"

- TPO + ZERO + HEAVY + ADV + VERB → "Intrusive Advocacy"

### 3.2 Document Structure

```markdown
## 1. Alignment Pattern

**Pattern**: [2-3 word name derived from codes]

**Core Dynamic**: [How narrative access + rhetorical intent combine]

**Reader Effect**: [What this produces for the reader]

## 2. Macro Variable Justifications

[Explain WHY each code was assigned—not just definitions]

## 3. Device Selections by Freytag Section

[How devices in each section EXECUTE the alignment pattern]

## 4. Alignment Effect

[What the complete alignment achieves for readers]
```

### 3.3 Validation

A valid reasoning document must:

1. Pattern derives from codes (not invented)

2. All macro codes referenced with justification

3. All micro devices mapped by Freytag section

4. Effect articulated as synthesis outcome
