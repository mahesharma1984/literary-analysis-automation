### Activity 1: Key Words

Underline words/phrases in the extract that relate to {{EXTRACT_FOCUS}}.

### Activity 2: Narrative Summary

Create a timeline to outline the events in the various scenes of the extract

---

**Teacher Note:** If >80% of students struggle here, STOP. Re-read extract aloud before proceeding.

---

## SECTION 2: DEVICE ANALYSIS (Building TVODE Components)

**Note to Students:** The answers you create in this section will become parts of your analytical sentence in the TVODE worksheet.

---

### DEVICE 1: {{DEVICE_1_NAME}}

#### Step 1: DEFINITION (Recognition)

**{{DEVICE_1_NAME}} is:**

{{DEVICE_1_DEFINITION}}

**Example from model:** {{DEVICE_1_MODEL_EXAMPLE}}

---

#### Step 2: FIND THE TOPIC (Matching)

**Your Turn:** Find an example of **{{DEVICE_1_NAME}}** in *{{TEXT_TITLE}}*.

**Where to look:**
{{DEVICE_1_EXAMPLE_LOCATIONS}}

**My Example:**

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **TOPIC** - the device you will analyze.

---

**Teacher Checkpoint:** Did students complete matching BEFORE moving to multiple choice? ☐ Yes ☐ No  
*(If No, STOP. Process breakdown - return to matching.)*

---

#### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE OBJECT (Multiple Choice)

**What does {{DEVICE_1_NAME}} DO in this text? What is its purpose or function?**

**A)** {{DEVICE_1_OPTION_A}}  
**B)** {{DEVICE_1_OPTION_B}}  
**C)** {{DEVICE_1_OPTION_C}}  
**D)** {{DEVICE_1_OPTION_D}}

**Your Answer:** ______

**TVODE Note:** This is your **OBJECT** - what the device does or shows in the text.

**Design Note:** Answers describe function/purpose (WHAT the device does), not effect (WHY). Two options should be "quite possible." All four options must be similar length (one clause each, roughly 10-15 words). Avoid making the correct answer noticeably longer or more specific than distractors. Randomize correct answer position across devices (don't always make B correct).

---

#### Step 4: ANALYZE IT (Sequencing)

**Put these details in order to show HOW {{DEVICE_1_NAME}} is used in the text.**

**A)** {{DEVICE_1_SEQUENCE_STEP_RANDOMIZED_1}}  
**B)** {{DEVICE_1_SEQUENCE_STEP_RANDOMIZED_2}}  
**C)** {{DEVICE_1_SEQUENCE_STEP_RANDOMIZED_3}}

**Your Answer:** 1-___ , 2-___ , 3-___

{{DEVICE_1_SEQUENCE_CORRECT_ORDER}}

**Teacher Note:** When generating worksheets, RANDOMIZE the order of options A, B, C so the correct sequence is NOT 1-A, 2-B, 3-C. Example correct answers: "1-C, 2-A, 3-B" or "1-B, 2-C, 3-A"

---

#### Step 5: WRITE THE DETAIL (Textual Evidence)

**Now that you understand HOW the device works, write the specific detail from the text that best shows this.**

Use this format: "shown through [specific detail/example from text]"

Your Detail:

________________________________________________________________________________

**TVODE Note:** This is your **DETAIL** - the specific textual evidence that supports your analysis.

**Teacher Note:** Students should write a phrase/short sentence based on their sequencing understanding. This becomes the Detail component of TVODE.

---

#### Step 6 (STANDARD/HIGH TIER): EFFECTS AND INSIGHTS

**Part A: Sort the Effects**

Read these effects and sort them into the three categories below.

**Tip:** Look for signal words:
- **What I Felt** → feeling words (uneasy, curious, tense, surprised)
- **What I Understood** → "shows," "reveals," "we learn," "tells us"
- **Big Idea** → "theme," "message," "the author is saying"

**Effects to Sort:**
1. {{DEVICE_1_EFFECT_1_SIMPLIFIED}}
2. {{DEVICE_1_EFFECT_2_SIMPLIFIED}}
3. {{DEVICE_1_EFFECT_3_SIMPLIFIED}}
4. {{DEVICE_1_EFFECT_4_SIMPLIFIED}}
5. {{DEVICE_1_EFFECT_5_SIMPLIFIED}}
6. {{DEVICE_1_EFFECT_6_SIMPLIFIED}}

| What I Felt | What I Understood | Big Idea Connection |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

---

**Part B: Build an Insight**

Pick TWO categories and combine them using a sentence starter:

**Feeling → Understanding:**
"The [feeling] I experienced helped me realize that..."

**Understanding → Feeling:**
"Once I understood [X], I felt..."

**Understanding → Big Idea:**
"This shows [X], which connects to the theme of..."

**Big Idea → Understanding:**
"The theme of [X] explains why..."

**Feeling → Big Idea:**
"Feeling [X] connects to the theme of..."

**Big Idea → Feeling:**
"The theme of [X] is why readers feel..."

My combination: ____________ → ____________

My sentence:

________________________________________________________________________________

---

**Part C: Swap and Compare**

Now write the SAME insight but flip your two categories around.

Flipped combination: ____________ → ____________

Flipped sentence:

________________________________________________________________________________

**Reflection:** How did the insight change when you swapped the order?

________________________________________________________________________________

---

**TVODE Note:** Your sentence from Part B or C becomes your **EFFECT** — the impact on meaning or the reader.

{{DEVICE_2_SEQUENCE_CORRECT_ORDER}}

**Teacher Note:** When generating worksheets, RANDOMIZE the order of options A, B, C so the correct sequence is NOT 1-A, 2-B, 3-C. Example correct answers: "1-C, 2-A, 3-B" or "1-B, 2-C, 3-A"

- **Object:** What it does (from Step 3)
- **Detail:** How it's shown (from Step 5)
- **Effect:** The impact (from Step 6)

**Next Step:** In the TVODE Sentence Construction Worksheet, you will combine these components with a connecting VERB to create complete analytical sentences.
