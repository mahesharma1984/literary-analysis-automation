# Literary Analysis Automation - Current Version
# Last Updated: November 21, 2025
# System Version: 5.0
# ✓ Verified empirically by checking actual outputs

## PRODUCTION PIPELINE (Verified Working):

Stage 1A: run_stage1a.py
  Input:  kernels/[book]_kernel_v3.3.json
  Output: outputs/[book]_stage1a_v5.0.json (verified: 5 weeks)

Stage 1B: run_stage1b.py
  Input:  outputs/[book]_stage1a_v5.0.json
  Output: outputs/[book]_stage1b_v5.0.json (verified: 5 weeks)
          outputs/[book]_Integrated_Progression.md

Stage 2:  run_stage2_fixed.py
  Input:  outputs/[book]_stage1b_v5.0.json
          kernels/[book]_kernel_v3.3.json
  Output: outputs/books/[book]_Week[N]_Worksheet.md
          outputs/books/[book]_Week[N]_TeacherKey.md

## HOW THIS WAS VERIFIED:

This VERSION.txt was generated by checking:
1. Actual output files exist and have correct structure
2. Stage 1A outputs contain 5-week packages
3. Stage 1B outputs contain 5-week packages
4. Data structures match between pipeline stages

Run `python3 verify_pipeline.py` to re-verify at any time.

## CRITICAL FILES:
- device_taxonomy_mapping.json (5-week categorization)
- run_stage1a.py (macro-micro package creation)
- run_stage1b.py (teaching progression)
- run_stage2_fixed.py (worksheet generation)

## FOLDER STRUCTURE:
- /kernels/         : Book kernels (v3.3 format)
- /outputs/         : Stage 1A/1B JSON outputs
- /outputs/books/   : Final worksheets & teacher keys
- /templates/       : Worksheet templates
- /tests/           : Test scripts
- /docs/            : Documentation
- /archive/         : Old/experimental files

## TESTING:
